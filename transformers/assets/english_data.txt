it happened after the death of saul when david was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had stayed two days in ziklag 
it happened on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes torn and earth on his head and so it was when he came to david that he fell to the earth and showed respect 
david said to him where do you come from ? he said to him i have escaped out of the camp of israel 
david said to him how did it go ? please tell me he answered the people have fled from the battle and many of the people also have fallen and are dead and saul and jonathan his son are dead also 
david said to the young man who told him how do you know that saul and jonathan his son are dead ? 
the young man who told him said as i happened by chance on mount gilboa behold saul was leaning on his spear and behold the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him 
when he looked behind him he saw me and called to me i answered here i am 
he said to me who are you ? i answered him i am an amalekite 
he said to me please stand beside me and kill me for anguish has taken hold of me because my life is yet whole in me 
so i stood beside him and killed him because i was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen i took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them here to my lord 
then david took hold on his clothes and tore them and likewise all the men who were with him 
they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for saul and for jonathan his son and for the people of yahweh and for the house of israel because they were fallen by the sword 
david said to the young man who told him where are you from ? he answered i am the son of a foreigner an amalekite 
david said to him how were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy yahweh s anointed ? 
david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan his son
 and he commanded them to teach the children of judah the song of the bow behold it is written in the book of jashar 
 your glory israel is slain on your high places ! how the mighty have fallen !
don t tell it in gath don t publish it in the streets of ashkelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph 
you mountains of gilboa let there be no dew nor rain on you neither fields of offerings for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away the shield of saul was not anointed with oil 
from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty jonathan s bow didn t turn back saul s sword didn t return empty 
saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions 
you daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in scarlet delicately who put ornaments of gold on your clothing 
how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle ! jonathan is slain on your high places 
i am distressed for you my brother jonathan you have been very pleasant to me your love to me was wonderful passing the love of women 
how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished ! 
it happened after this that david inquired of yahweh saying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah ? yahweh said to him go up david said where shall i go up ? he said to hebron 
so david went up there and his two wives also ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite 
david brought up his men who were with him every man with his household they lived in the cities of hebron 
the men of judah came and there they anointed david king over the house of judah they told david saying the men of jabesh gilead were those who buried saul 
david sent messengers to the men of jabesh gilead and said to them blessed are you by yahweh that you have shown this kindness to your lord even to saul and have buried him 
now may yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you i also will reward you for this kindness because you have done this thing 
now therefore let your hands be strong and be valiant for saul your lord is dead and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them 
now abner the son of ner captain of saul s army had taken ishbosheth the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim 
and he made him king over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and over ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel 
ishbosheth saul s son was forty years old when he began to reign over israel and he reigned two years but the house of judah followed david 
the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months 
abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon 
joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out and met them by the pool of gibeon and they sat down the one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool 
abner said to joab please let the young men arise and play before us ! joab said let them arise ! 
then they arose and went over by number twelve for benjamin and for ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of the servants of david 
they each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his fellow s side so they fell down together therefore that place was called helkath hazzurim which is in gibeon 
the battle was very severe that day and abner was beaten and the men of israel before the servants of david 
the three sons of zeruiah were there joab and abishai and asahel and asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle 
asahel pursued after abner and in going he didn t turn to the right hand nor to the left from following abner 
then abner looked behind him and said is it you asahel ? he answered it is i 
abner said to him turn aside to your right hand or to your left and grab one of the young men and take his armor but asahel would not turn aside from following him 
abner said again to asahel turn aside from following me why should i strike you to the ground ? how then should i hold up my face to joab your brother ? 
however he refused to turn aside therefore abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body so that the spear came out behind him and he fell down there and died in the same place it happened that as many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still 
but joab and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of ammah that lies before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon 
the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner and became one band and stood on the top of a hill 
then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour forever ? don t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end ? how long shall it be then before you ask the people to return from following their brothers ? 
joab said as god lives if you had not spoken surely then in the morning the people would have gone away and not each followed his brother 
so joab blew the trumpet and all the people stood still and pursued after israel no more neither fought they any more 
abner and his men went all that night through the arabah and they passed over the jordan and went through all bithron and came to mahanaim 
joab returned from following abner and when he had gathered all the people together there lacked of david s servants nineteen men and asahel 
but the servants of david had struck of benjamin and of abner s men so that three hundred sixty men died 
they took up asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father which was in bethlehem joab and his men went all night and the day broke on them at hebron 
now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of david and david grew stronger and stronger but the house of saul grew weaker and weaker 
to david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess 
and his second chileab of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur 
and the fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son of abital 
and the sixth ithream of eglah david s wife these were born to david in hebron 
it happened while there was war between the house of saul and the house of david that abner made himself strong in the house of saul 
now saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter of aiah and ishbosheth said to abner why have you gone in to my father s concubine ? 
then was abner very angry for the words of ishbosheth and said am i a dog s head that belongs to judah ? today i show kindness to the house of saul your father to his brothers and to his friends and have not delivered you into the hand of david and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman !
he could not answer abner another word because he feared him 
abner sent messengers to david on his behalf saying whose is the land ? and saying make your alliance with me and behold my hand shall be with you to bring all israel around to you 
he said good i will make a treaty with you but one thing i require of you that is you shall not see my face unless you first bring michal saul s daughter when you come to see my face 
david sent messengers to ishbosheth saul s son saying deliver me my wife michal whom i pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the philistines 
ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from paltiel the son of laish 
her husband went with her weeping as he went and followed her to bahurim then abner said to him go ! return ! and he returned 
abner had communication with the elders of israel saying in times past you sought for david to be king over you 
now then do it for yahweh has spoken of david saying by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies 
abner also spoke in the ears of benjamin and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel and to the whole house of benjamin 
so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him david made abner and the men who were with him a feast 
abner said to david i will arise and go and will gather all israel to my lord the king that they may make a covenant with you and that you may reign over all that your soul desires david sent abner away and he went in peace 
behold the servants of david and joab came from a foray and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace 
when joab and all the army who was with him had come they told joab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he has sent him away and he is gone in peace 
then joab came to the king and said what have you done ? behold abner came to you why is it that you have sent him away and he is quite gone ?
you know abner the son of ner that he came to deceive you and to know your going out and your coming in and to know all that you do 
when joab had come out from david he sent messengers after abner and they brought him back from the well of sirah but david didn t know it 
when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly and struck him there in the body so that he died for the blood of asahel his brother 
afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are guiltless before yahweh forever of the blood of abner the son of ner 
let it fall on the head of joab and on all his father s house let there not fail from the house of joab one who has an issue or who is a leper or who leans on a staff or who falls by the sword or who lacks bread 
so joab and abishai his brother killed abner because he had killed their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle 
the king lamented for abner and said should abner die as a fool dies ?
your hands were not bound nor your feet put into fetters as a man falls before the children of iniquity so you fell all the people wept again over him 
all the people came to cause david to eat bread while it was yet day but david swore saying god do so to me and more also if i taste bread or anything else until the sun goes down 
all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as whatever the king did pleased all the people 
so all the people and all israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill abner the son of ner 
the king said to his servants don t you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in israel ?
i am this day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah are too hard for me may yahweh reward the evildoer according to his wickedness 
when saul s son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands became feeble and all the israelites were troubled 
saul s son had two men who were captains of bands the name of the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of rimmon the beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also is reckoned to benjamin 
and the beerothites fled to gittaim and have lived as foreigners there until this day 
now jonathan saul s son had a son who was lame of his feet he was five years old when the news came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it happened as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame his name was mephibosheth 
the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth as he took his rest at noon 
they brought the head of ishbosheth to david to hebron and said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul your enemy who sought your life ! yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of saul and of his seed 
david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said to them as yahweh lives who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity 
when someone told me behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good news i took hold of him and killed him in ziklag which was the reward i gave him for his news 
how much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed shall i not now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earth ? 
david commanded his young men and they killed them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged them up beside the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth and buried it in the grave of abner in hebron 
then came all the tribes of israel to david to hebron and spoke saying behold we are your bone and your flesh 
in times past when saul was king over us it was you who led out and brought in israel yahweh said to you you shall be shepherd of my people israel and you shall be prince over israel 
so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king david made a covenant with them in hebron before yahweh and they anointed david king over israel 
david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years 
in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned thirty three years over all israel and judah 
the king and his men went to jerusalem against the jebusites the inhabitants of the land who spoke to david saying unless you take away the blind and the lame you shall not come in here thinking david can t come in here 
nevertheless david took the stronghold of zion the same is the city of david 
david said on that day whoever strikes the jebusites let him get up to the watercourse and strike the lame and the blind who are hated by david s soul therefore they say the blind and the lame can t come into the house 
david lived in the stronghold and called it the city of david david built around from millo and inward 
david grew greater and greater for yahweh the god of armies was with him 
hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees and carpenters and masons and they built david a house 
david perceived that yahweh had established him king over israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israel s sake 
david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem after he had come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters born to david 
these are the names of those who were born to him in jerusalem shammua and shobab and nathan and solomon 
and ibhar and elishua and nepheg and japhia 
and elishama and eliada and eliphelet 
when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard of it and went down to the stronghold 
now the philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim 
david inquired of yahweh saying shall i go up against the philistines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? yahweh said to david go up for i will certainly deliver the philistines into your hand 
david came to baal perazim and david struck them there and he said yahweh has broken my enemies before me like the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place baal perazim 
they left their images there and david and his men took them away 
the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim 
when david inquired of yahweh he said you shall not go up circle around behind them and attack them over against the mulberry trees 
it shall be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees that then you shall stir yourself up for then yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the philistines 
david did so as yahweh commanded him and struck the philistines from geba until you come to gezer 
david again gathered together all the chosen men of israel thirty thousand 
david arose and went with all the people who were with him from baale judah to bring up from there the ark of god which is called by the name even the name of yahweh of armies who sits above the cherubim 
they set the ark of god on a new cart and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in the hill and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab drove the new cart 
they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was in the hill with the ark of god and ahio went before the ark 
david and all the house of israel played before yahweh with all kinds of instruments made of fir wood and with harps and with stringed instruments and with tambourines and with castanets and with cymbals 
when they came to the threshing floor of nacon uzzah reached for the ark of god and took hold of it for the cattle stumbled 
the anger of yahweh was kindled against uzzah and god struck him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god 
david was displeased because yahweh had broken forth on uzzah and he called that place perez uzzah to this day 
david was afraid of yahweh that day and he said how shall the ark of yahweh come to me ? 
so david would not move the ark of yahweh to be with him in the city of david but david carried it aside into the house of obed edom the gittite 
the ark of yahweh remained in the house of obed edom the gittite three months and yahweh blessed obed edom and all his house 
it was told king david saying yahweh has blessed the house of obed edom and all that pertains to him because of the ark of god david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obed edom into the city of david with joy 
it was so that when those who bore the ark of yahweh had gone six paces he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf 
david danced before yahweh with all his might and david was clothed in a linen ephod 
so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of yahweh with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet 
it was so as the ark of yahweh came into the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looked out at the window and saw king david leaping and dancing before yahweh and she despised him in her heart 
they brought in the ark of yahweh and set it in its place in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before yahweh 
when david had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of yahweh of armies 
he gave to all the people even among the whole multitude of israel both to men and women to everyone a portion of bread dates and raisins so all the people departed everyone to his house 
then david returned to bless his household michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious the king of israel was today who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself ! 
david said to michal it was before yahweh who chose me above your father and above all his house to appoint me prince over the people of yahweh over israel therefore will i celebrate before yahweh 
i will be yet more vile than this and will be base in my own sight but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken they shall honor me 
michal the daughter of saul had no child to the day of her death 
it happened when the king lived in his house and yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around 
that the king said to nathan the prophet see now i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of god dwells within curtains 
nathan said to the king go do all that is in your heart for yahweh is with you 
it happened the same night that the word of yahweh came to nathan saying 
 go and tell my servant david thus says yahweh shall you build me a house for me to dwell in ?
for i have not lived in a house since the day that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle 
in all places in which i have walked with all the children of israel did i say a word to any of the tribes of israel whom i commanded to be shepherd of my people israel saying why have you not built me a house of cedar ? 
now therefore you shall tell my servant david this thus says yahweh of armies i took you from the sheep pen from following the sheep that you should be prince over my people over israel 
i have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you i will make you a great name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth 
when your days are fulfilled and you shall sleep with your fathers i will set up your seed after you who shall proceed out of your bowels and i will establish his kingdom 
he shall build a house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom forever 
i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commits iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men 
but my loving kindness shall not depart from him as i took it from saul whom i put away before you 
your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you your throne shall be established forever 
according to all these words and according to all this vision so nathan spoke to david 
then david the king went in and sat before yahweh and he said who am i lord yahweh and what is my house that you have brought me thus far ?
this was yet a small thing in your eyes lord yahweh but you have spoken also of your servant s house for a great while to come and this after the way of men lord yahweh !
what more can david say to you ? for you know your servant lord yahweh 
for your word s sake and according to your own heart you have worked all this greatness to make your servant know it 
therefore you are great yahweh god for there is none like you neither is there any god besides you according to all that we have heard with our ears 
what one nation in the earth is like your people even like israel whom god went to redeem to himself for a people and to make himself a name and to do great things for you and awesome things for your land before your people whom you redeem to yourself out of egypt from the nations and their gods ?
you established for yourself your people israel to be a people to you forever and you yahweh became their god 
now yahweh god the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house confirm it forever and do as you have spoken 
let your name be magnified forever saying yahweh of armies is god over israel and the house of your servant david shall be established before you 
for you yahweh of armies the god of israel have revealed to your servant saying i will build you a house therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you 
 now o lord yahweh you are god and your words are truth and you have promised this good thing to your servant 
now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant that it may continue forever before you for you lord yahweh have spoken it let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing 
after this it happened that david struck the philistines and subdued them and david took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the philistines 
he struck moab and measured them with the line making them to lie down on the ground and he measured two lines to put to death and one full line to keep alive the moabites became servants to david and brought tribute 
david struck also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as he went to recover his dominion at the river 
david took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david hamstrung all the chariot horses but reserved of them for one hundred chariots 
when the syrians of damascus came to help hadadezer king of zobah david struck of the syrians two and twenty thousand men 
then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians became servants to david and brought tribute yahweh gave victory to david wherever he went 
david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem 
from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king david took exceeding much brass 
when toi king of hamath heard that david had struck all the army of hadadezer 
then toi sent joram his son to king david to greet him and to bless him because he had fought against hadadezer and struck him for hadadezer had wars with toi joram brought with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass 
king david also dedicated these to yahweh with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued 
of syria and of moab and of the children of ammon and of the philistines and of amalek and of the spoil of hadadezer son of rehob king of zobah 
david earned a reputation when he returned from smiting the syrians in the valley of salt even eighteen thousand men 
he put garrisons in edom throughout all edom put he garrisons and all the edomites became servants to david yahweh gave victory to david wherever he went 
david reigned over all israel and david executed justice and righteousness to all his people 
joab the son of zeruiah was over the army and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder 
and zadok the son of ahitub and ahimelech the son of abiathar were priests and seraiah was scribe 
and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and david s sons were chief ministers 
david said is there yet any who is left of the house of saul that i may show him kindness for jonathan s sake ? 
there was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and they called him to david and the king said to him are you ziba ? he said your servant is he 
the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul that i may show the kindness of god to him ? ziba said to the king jonathan has yet a son who is lame of his feet 
the king said to him where is he ? ziba said to the king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in lo debar 
then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machir the son of ammiel from lo debar 
mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul came to david and fell on his face and showed respect david said mephibosheth he answered behold your servant ! 
david said to him don t be afraid of him for i will surely show you kindness for jonathan your father s sake and will restore to you all the land of saul your father you shall eat bread at my table continually 
he bowed down and said what is your servant that you should look on such a dead dog as i am ? 
you shall till the land for him you and your sons and your servants and you shall bring in the harvest that your master s son may have bread to eat but mephibosheth your master s son shall eat bread always at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants 
then ziba said to the king according to all that my lord the king commands his servant so your shall servant do so mephibosheth ate at the king s table like one of the king s sons 
mephibosheth had a young son whose name was mica all that lived in the house of ziba were servants to mephibosheth 
so mephibosheth lived in jerusalem for he ate continually at the king s table he was lame in both his feet 
it happened after this that the king of the children of ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his place 
david said i will show kindness to hanun the son of nahash as his father showed kindness to me so david sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father david s servants came into the land of the children of ammon 
but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun their lord do you think that david honors your father in that he has sent comforters to you ? hasn t david sent his servants to you to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it ? 
so hanun took david s servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away 
when they told it to david he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed the king said wait at jericho until your beards have grown and then return 
when the children of ammon saw that they were become odious to david the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of beth rehob and the syrians of zobah twenty thousand footmen and the king of maacah with one thousand men and the men of tob twelve thousand men 
when david heard of it he sent joab and all the army of the mighty men 
the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate and the syrians of zobah and of rehob and the men of tob and maacah were by themselves in the field 
now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the syrians 
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of abishai his brother and he put them in array against the children of ammon 
he said if the syrians are too strong for me then you shall help me but if the children of ammon are too strong for you then i will come and help you 
be courageous and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our god and yahweh do that which seems good to him 
so joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the syrians and they fled before him 
when the children of ammon saw that the syrians had fled they likewise fled before abishai and entered into the city then joab returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem 
when the syrians saw that they were defeated by israel they gathered themselves together 
hadadezer sent and brought out the syrians who were beyond the river and they came to helam with shobach the captain of the army of hadadezer at their head 
it was told david and he gathered all israel together and passed over the jordan and came to helam the syrians set themselves in array against david and fought with him 
the syrians fled before israel and david killed of the syrians seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand horsemen and struck shobach the captain of their army so that he died there 
when all the kings who were servants to hadadezer saw that they were defeated before israel they made peace with israel and served them so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any more 
it happened at the return of the year at the time when kings go out that david sent joab and his servants with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and besieged rabbah but david stayed at jerusalem 
it happened at evening that david arose from off his bed and walked on the roof of the king s house and from the roof he saw a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful to look on 
david sent and inquired after the woman one said isn t this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite ? 
david sent messengers and took her and she came in to him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned to her house 
the woman conceived and she sent and told david and said i am with child 
david sent to joab send me uriah the hittite joab sent uriah to david 
when uriah had come to him david asked of him how joab did and how the people fared and how the war prospered 
david said to uriah go down to your house and wash your feet uriah departed out of the king s house and a gift from the king was sent after him 
but uriah slept at the door of the king s house with all the servants of his lord and didn t go down to his house 
when they had told david saying uriah didn t go down to his house david said to uriah haven t you come from a journey ? why didn t you go down to your house ? 
uriah said to david the ark israel and judah are staying in tents and my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open field shall i then go into my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife ? as you live and as your soul lives i will not do this thing ! 
david said to uriah stay here today also and tomorrow i will let you depart so uriah stayed in jerusalem that day and the next day 
when david had called him he ate and drink before him and he made him drunk at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but didn t go down to his house 
it happened in the morning that david wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of uriah 
he wrote in the letter saying send uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle and retreat from him that he may be struck and die 
it happened when joab kept watch on the city that he assigned uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were 
the men of the city went out and fought with joab some of the people fell even of the servants of david and uriah the hittite died also 
then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war 
and he commanded the messenger saying when you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king 
it shall be that if the king s wrath arise and he asks you why did you go so near to the city to fight ? didn t you know that they would shoot from the wall ?
who struck abimelech the son of jerubbesheth ? didn t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at thebez ? why did you go so near the wall ? then you shall say your servant uriah the hittite is dead also 
so the messenger went and came and showed david all that joab had sent him for 
the messenger said to david the men prevailed against us and came out to us into the field and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate 
the shooters shot at your servants from off the wall and some of the king s servants are dead and your servant uriah the hittite is dead also 
then david said to the messenger thus you shall tell joab don t let this thing displease you for the sword devours one as well as another make your battle stronger against the city and overthrow it encourage him 
when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead she made lamentation for her husband 
when the mourning was past david sent and took her home to his house and she became his wife and bore him a son but the thing that david had done displeased yahweh 
yahweh sent nathan to david he came to him and said to him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor 
the rich man had very many flocks and herds 
but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and raised it grew up together with him and with his children it ate of his own food drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was to him like a daughter 
a traveler came to the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him but took the poor man s lamb and dressed it for the man who had come to him 
david s anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as yahweh lives the man who has done this is worthy to die !
he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity ! 
nathan said to david you are the man this is what yahweh the god of israel says i anointed you king over israel and i delivered you out of the hand of saul 
i gave you your master s house and your master s wives into your bosom and gave you the house of israel and of judah and if that would have been too little i would have added to you many more such things 
why have you despised the word of yahweh to do that which is evil in his sight ? you have struck uriah the hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife and have slain him with the sword of the children of ammon 
now therefore the sword will never depart from your house because you have despised me and have taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be your wife 
 this is what yahweh says behold i will raise up evil against you out of your own house and i will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun 
for you did it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the sun 
david said to nathan i have sinned against yahweh nathan said to david yahweh also has put away your sin you will not die 
however because by this deed you have given great occasion to yahweh s enemies to blaspheme the child also who is born to you shall surely die 
nathan departed to his house yahweh struck the child that uriah s wife bore to david and it was very sick 
david therefore begged god for the child and david fasted and went in and lay all night on the earth 
the elders of his house arose beside him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them 
it happened on the seventh day that the child died the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spoke to him and he didn t listen to our voice how will he then harm himself if we tell him that the child is dead ? 
but when david saw that his servants were whispering together david perceived that the child was dead and david said to his servants is the child dead ? they said he is dead 
then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothing and he came into the house of yahweh and worshiped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he ate 
then his servants said to him what is this that you have done ? you fasted and wept for the child while he was alive but when the child was dead you rose up and ate bread 
he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who knows whether yahweh will not be gracious to me that the child may live ? 
but now he is dead why should i fast ? can i bring him back again ? i shall go to him but he will not return to me 
david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in to her and lay with her she bore a son and he called his name solomon yahweh loved him 
and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he named him jedidiah for yahweh s sake 
now joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and took the royal city 
joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought against rabbah yes i have taken the city of waters 
now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called after my name 
david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah and fought against it and took it 
he took the crown of their king from off his head and its weight was a talent of gold and in it were precious stones and it was set on david s head he brought out the spoil of the city exceeding much 
he brought out the people who were therein and put them under saws and under iron picks and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brick kiln and he did so to all the cities of the children of ammon david and all the people returned to jerusalem 
it happened after this that absalom the son of david had a beautiful sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her 
amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister tamar for she was a virgin and it seemed hard to amnon to do anything to her 
but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah david s brother and jonadab was a very subtle man 
he said to him why son of the king are you so sad from day to day ? won t you tell me ? amnon said to him i love tamar my brother absalom s sister 
jonadab said to him lay down on your bed and pretend to be sick when your father comes to see you tell him please let my sister tamar come and give me bread to eat and dress the food in my sight that i may see it and eat it from her hand 
so amnon lay down and faked being sick when the king came to see him amnon said to the king please let my sister tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat from her hand 
then david sent home to tamar saying go now to your brother amnon s house and prepare food for him 
so tamar went to her brother amnon s house and he was laid down she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes 
she took the pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat amnon said have all men leave me every man went out from him 
amnon said to tamar bring the food into the room that i may eat from your hand tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the room to amnon her brother 
when she had brought them near to him to eat he took hold of her and said to her come lie with me my sister ! 
she answered him no my brother do not force me ! for no such thing ought to be done in israel don t you do this folly 
i where would i carry my shame ? and as for you you will be as one of the fools in israel now therefore please speak to the king for he will not withhold me from you 
however he would not listen to her voice but being stronger than she he forced her and lay with her 
then amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her amnon said to her arise be gone ! 
she said to him not so because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me ! but he would not listen to her 
then he called his servant who ministered to him and said put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her 
she had a garment of various colors on her for with such robes were the king s daughters who were virgins dressed then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her 
tamar put ashes on her head and tore her garment of various colors that was on her and she laid her hand on her head and went her way crying aloud as she went 
absalom her brother said to her has amnon your brother been with you ? but now hold your peace my sister he is your brother don t take this thing to heart so tamar remained desolate in her brother absalom s house 
but when king david heard of all these things he was very angry 
absalom spoke to amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar 
it happened after two full years that absalom had sheepshearers in baal hazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the king s sons 
absalom came to the king and said see now your servant has sheepshearers please let the king and his servants go with your servant 
the king said to absalom no my son let us not all go lest we be burdensome to you he pressed him however he would not go but blessed him 
then absalom said if not please let my brother amnon go with us the king said to him why should he go with you ? 
but absalom pressed him and he let amnon and all the king s sons go with him 
absalom commanded his servants saying mark now when amnon s heart is merry with wine and when i tell you strike amnon then kill him don t be afraid haven t i commanded you ? be courageous and be valiant ! 
the servants of absalom did to amnon as absalom had commanded then all the king s sons arose and every man got up on his mule and fled 
it happened while they were in the way that the news came to david saying absalom has slain all the king s sons and there is not one of them left ! 
then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn 
jonadab the son of shimeah david s brother answered don t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king s sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister tamar 
now therefore don t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the king s sons are dead for amnon only is dead 
but absalom fled the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him 
jonadab said to the king behold the king s sons are coming ! it is as your servant said 
it happened as soon as he had finished speaking that behold the king s sons came and lifted up their voice and wept the king also and all his servants wept bitterly 
but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihur king of geshur david mourned for his son every day 
so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years 
now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the king s heart was toward absalom 
joab sent to tekoa and fetched there a wise woman and said to her please act like a mourner and put on mourning clothing please and don t anoint yourself with oil but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead 
go in to the king and speak like this to him so joab put the words in her mouth 
when the woman of tekoa spoke to the king she fell on her face to the ground showed respect and said help o king ! 
the king said to her what ails you ? she answered truly i am a widow and my husband is dead 
your handmaid had two sons and they both fought together in the field and there was no one to part them but the one struck the other and killed him 
behold the whole family has risen against your handmaid and they say deliver him who struck his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed and so destroy the heir also thus they would quench my coal which is left and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth 
the king said to the woman go to your house and i will give a command concerning you 
the woman of tekoa said to the king my lord o king the iniquity be on me and on my father s house and the king and his throne be guiltless 
the king said whoever says anything to you bring him to me and he shall not touch you any more 
then she said please let the king remember yahweh your god that the avenger of blood destroy not any more lest they destroy my son he said as yahweh lives not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth 
then the woman said please let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king he said say on 
the woman said why then have you devised such a thing against the people of god ? for in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty in that the king does not bring home again his banished one 
for we must die and are as water split on the ground which can t be gathered up again neither does god take away life but devises means that he who is banished not be an outcast from him 
now therefore seeing that i have come to speak this word to my lord the king it is because the people have made me afraid and your handmaid said i will now speak to the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant 
for the king will hear to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god 
then your handmaid said please let the word of my lord the king bring rest for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to discern good and bad may yahweh your god be with you 
then the king answered the woman please don t hide anything from me that i ask you the woman said let my lord the king now speak 
the king said is the hand of joab with you in all this ? the woman answered as your soul lives my lord the king no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken for your servant joab he urged me and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid 
to change the face of the matter has your servant joab done this thing my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god to know all things that are in the earth 
the king said to joab behold now i have done this thing go therefore bring the young man absalom back 
joab fell to the ground on his face showed respect and blessed the king joab said today your servant knows that i have found favor in your sight my lord king in that the king has performed the request of his servant 
so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom to jerusalem 
the king said let him return to his own house but let him not see my face so absalom returned to his own house and didn t see the king s face 
now in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him 
when he cut the hair of his head now it was at every year s end that he cut it because it was heavy on him therefore he cut it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king s weight 
to absalom there were born three sons and one daughter whose name was tamar she was a woman of a beautiful face 
absalom lived two full years in jerusalem and he didn t see the king s face 
then absalom sent for joab to send him to the king but he would not come to him and he sent again a second time but he would not come 
therefore he said to his servants behold joab s field is near mine and he has barley there go and set it on fire absalom s servants set the field on fire 
then joab arose and came to absalom to his house and said to him why have your servants set my field on fire ? 
absalom answered joab behold i sent to you saying come here that i may send you to the king to say why have i come from geshur ? it would be better for me to be there still now therefore let me see the king s face and if there is iniquity in me let him kill me 
so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called for absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom 
it happened after this that absalom prepared him a chariot and horses and fifty men to run before him 
absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate it was so that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment then absalom called to him and said what city are you from ? he said your servant is of one of the tribes of israel 
absalom said to him behold your matters are good and right but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you 
absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me and i would do him justice ! 
it was so that when any man came near to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took hold of him and kissed him 
absalom did this sort of thing to all israel who came to the king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel 
it happened at the end of forty years that absalom said to the king please let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed to yahweh in hebron 
for your servant vowed a vow while i stayed at geshur in syria saying if yahweh shall indeed bring me again to jerusalem then i will serve yahweh 
the king said to him go in peace so he arose and went to hebron 
but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel saying as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet then you shall say absalom is king in hebron ! 
two hundred men went with absalom out of jerusalem who were invited and went in their simplicity and they didn t know anything 
absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite david s counselor from his city even from giloh while he was offering the sacrifices the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with absalom 
a messenger came to david saying the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom 
david said to all his servants who were with him at jerusalem arise and let us flee for else none of us shall escape from absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us quickly and bring down evil on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword 
the king s servants said to the king behold your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses 
the king went forth and all his household after him the king left ten women who were concubines to keep the house 
the king went forth and all the people after him and they stayed in beth merhak 
all his servants passed on beside him and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred men who came after him from gath passed on before the king 
then the king said to ittai the gittite why do you also go with us ? return and stay with the king for you are a foreigner and also an exile return to your own place 
whereas you came but yesterday should i this day make you go up and down with us since i go where i may ? return and take back your brothers mercy and truth be with you 
ittai answered the king and said as yahweh lives and as my lord the king lives surely in what place my lord the king shall is whether for death or for life even there also will your servant be 
david said to ittai go and pass over ittai the gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones who were with him 
all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people passed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness 
behold zadok also came and all the levites with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and abiathar went up until all the people finished passing out of the city 
the king said to zadok carry back the ark of god into the city if i find favor in the eyes of yahweh he will bring me again and show me both it and his habitation 
but if he say thus i have no delight in you behold here am i let him do to me as seems good to him 
the king said also to zadok the priest aren t you a seer ? return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz your son and jonathan the son of abiathar 
behold i will stay at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me 
zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem and they stayed there 
david went up by the ascent of the mount of olives and wept as he went up and he had his head covered and went barefoot and all the people who were with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went up 
someone told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom david said yahweh please turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness 
it happened that when david had come to the top where god was worshiped behold hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat torn and earth on his head 
david said to him if you pass on with me then you will be a burden to me 
but if you return to the city and tell absalom i will be your servant o king as i have been your father s servant in time past so will i now be your servant then will you defeat for me the counsel of ahithophel 
don t you have zadok and abiathar the priests there with you ? therefore it shall be that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king s house you shall tell it to zadok and abiathar the priests 
behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz zadok s son and jonathan abiathar s son and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear 
so hushai david s friend came into the city and absalom came into jerusalem 
when david was a little past the top behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of donkeys saddled and on them two hundred loaves of bread and one hundred clusters of raisins and one hundred summer fruits and a bottle of wine 
the king said to ziba what do you mean by these ? ziba said the donkeys are for the king s household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink 
the king said where is your master s son ? ziba said to the king behold he is staying in jerusalem for he said today the house of israel will restore me the kingdom of my father 
then the king said to ziba behold all that pertains to mephibosheth is yours ziba said i do obeisance let me find favor in your sight my lord o king 
when king david came to bahurim behold a man of the family of the house of saul came out whose name was shimei the son of gera he came out and cursed still as he came 
he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left 
shimei said when he cursed be gone be gone you man of blood and base fellow !
yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of saul in whose place you have reigned ! yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom your son ! behold you are caught by your own mischief because you are a man of blood ! 
then abishai the son of zeruiah said to the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? please let me go over and take off his head 
the king said what have i to do with you you sons of zeruiah ? because he curses and because yahweh has said to him curse david who then shall say why have you done so ? 
david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son who came forth from my bowels seeks my life how much more this benjamite now ? leave him alone and let him curse for yahweh has invited him 
it may be that yahweh will look on the wrong done to me and that yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today 
so david and his men went by the way and shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went threw stones at him and threw dust 
the king and all the people who were with him came weary and he refreshed himself there 
absalom and all the people the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel with him 
it happened when hushai the archite david s friend had come to absalom that hushai said to absalom long live the king ! long live the king ! 
absalom said to hushai is this your kindness to your friend ? why didn t you go with your friend ? 
hushai said to absalom no but whomever yahweh and this people and all the men of israel have chosen his will i be and with him i will stay 
again whom should i serve ? shouldn t i serve in the presence of his son ? as i have served in your father s presence so will i be in your presence 
then absalom said to ahithophel give your counsel what we shall do 
ahithophel said to absalom go in to your father s concubines that he has left to keep the house then all israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father then the hands of all who are with you will be strong 
so they spread absalom a tent on the top of the house and absalom went in to his father s concubines in the sight of all israel 
the counsel of ahithophel which he gave in those days was as if a man inquired at the oracle of god so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom 
moreover ahithophel said to absalom let me now choose twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david tonight 
i will come on him while he is weary and exhausted and will make him afraid all the people who are with him shall flee i will strike the king only 
and i will bring back all the people to you the man whom you seek is as if all returned all the people shall be in peace 
the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of israel 
then absalom said now call hushai the archite also and let us hear likewise what he says 
when hushai had come to absalom absalom spoke to him saying ahithophel has spoken like this shall we do what he says ? if not speak up 
hushai said to absalom the counsel that ahithophel has given this time is not good 
hushai said moreover you know your father and his men that they are mighty men and they are fierce in their minds like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field your father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people 
behold he is now hidden in some pit or in some other place it will happen when some of them have fallen at the first that whoever hears it will say there is a slaughter among the people who follow absalom ! 
even he who is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion will utterly melt for all israel knows that your father is a mighty man and those who are with him are valiant men 
but i counsel that all israel be gathered together to you from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that you go to battle in your own person 
so shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one 
moreover if he be gone into a city then shall all israel bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until there isn t one small stone found there 
absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel for yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that yahweh might bring evil on absalom 
then hushai said to zadok and to abiathar the priests ahithophel counseled absalom and the elders of israel that way and i have counseled this way 
now therefore send quickly and tell david saying don t lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness but by all means pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people who are with him 
now jonathan and ahimaaz were staying by en rogel and a female servant used to go and tell them and they went and told king david for they might not be seen to come into the city 
but a boy saw them and told absalom then they both went away quickly and came to the house of a man in bahurim who had a well in his court and they went down there 
the woman took and spread the covering over the well s mouth and spread out bruised grain on it and nothing was known 
absalom s servants came to the woman to the house and they said where are ahimaaz and jonathan ? the woman said to them they have gone over the brook of water when they had sought and could not find them they returned to jerusalem 
it happened after they had departed that they came up out of the well and went and told king david and they said to david arise and pass quickly over the water for thus has ahithophel counseled against you 
then david arose and all the people who were with him and they passed over the jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the jordan 
when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his donkey and arose and went home to his city and set his house in order and hanged himself and he died and was buried in the tomb of his father 
then david came to mahanaim absalom passed over the jordan he and all the men of israel with him 
absalom set amasa over the army instead of joab now amasa was the son of a man whose name was ithra the israelite who went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joab s mother 
israel and absalom encamped in the land of gilead 
it happened when david had come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim 
david numbered the people who were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them 
david sent forth the people a third part under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah joab s brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite the king said to the people i will surely go forth with you myself also 
but the people said you shall not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but you are worth ten thousand of us therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city 
the king said to them i will do what seems best to you the king stood beside the gate and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands 
the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom all the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning absalom 
so the people went out into the field against israel and the battle was in the forest of ephraim 
the people of israel were struck there before the servants of david and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men 
for the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured 
absalom happened to meet the servants of david absalom was riding on his mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the sky and earth and the mule that was under him went on 
a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw absalom hanging in an oak 
joab said to the man who told him behold you saw it and why didn t you strike him there to the ground ? i would have given you ten pieces of silver and a sash 
the man said to joab though i should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand i still wouldn t put forth my hand against the king s son for in our hearing the king commanded you and abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man absalom 
otherwise if i had dealt falsely against his life and there is no matter hidden from the king then you yourself would have set yourself against me 
then joab said i m not going to wait like this with you he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak 
ten young men who bore joab s armor surrounded and struck absalom and killed him 
joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing after israel for joab held back the people 
they took absalom and cast him into the great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones then all israel fled everyone to his tent 
now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king s dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in memory he called the pillar after his own name and it is called absalom s monument to this day 
then ahimaaz the son of zadok said let me now run and bear the king news how that yahweh has avenged him of his enemies 
joab said to him you shall not be the bearer of news this day but you shall bear news another day but today you shall bear no news because the king s son is dead 
then joab said to the cushite go tell the king what you have seen ! the cushite bowed himself to joab and ran 
then ahimaaz the son of zadok said yet again to joab but come what may please let me also run after the cushite joab said why do you want to run my son since that you will have no reward for the news ? 
 but come what may he said i will run he said to him run ! then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and outran the cushite 
now david was sitting between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone 
the watchman cried and told the king the king said if he is alone there is news in his mouth he came closer and closer 
the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called to the porter and said behold a man running alone ! the king said he also brings news 
the watchman said i think the running of the first one is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok the king said he is a good man and comes with good news 
ahimaaz called and said to the king all is well he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth and said blessed is yahweh your god who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king ! 
the king said is it well with the young man absalom ? ahimaaz answered when joab sent the king s servant even me your servant i saw a great tumult but i don t know what it was 
the king said turn aside and stand here he turned aside and stood still 
behold the cushite came the cushite said news for my lord the king for yahweh has avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you 
the king said to the cushite is it well with the young man absalom ? the cushite answered may the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you to do you harm be as that young man is 
the king was much moved and went up to the room over the gate and wept as he went he said my son absalom ! my son my son absalom ! i wish i had died for you absalom my son my son ! 
it was told joab behold the king weeps and mourns for absalom 
the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people for the people heard it said that day the king grieves for his son 
the people sneaked into the city that day as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle 
the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice my son absalom absalom my son my son ! 
joab came into the house to the king and said you have shamed this day the faces of all your servants who this day have saved your life and the lives of your sons and of your daughters and the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines 
in that you love those who hate you and hate those who love you for you have declared this day that princes and servants are nothing to you for today i perceive that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it would have pleased you well 
now therefore arise go out and speak to comfort your servants for i swear by yahweh if you don t go out not a man will stay with you this night that would be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now 
then the king arose and sat in the gate they told to all the people saying behold the king is sitting in the gate all the people came before the king now israel had fled every man to his tent 
all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel saying the king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies and he saved us out of the hand of the philistines and now he has fled out of the land from absalom 
absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle now therefore why don t you speak a word of bringing the king back ? 
king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying speak to the elders of judah saying why are you the last to bring the king back to his house ? since the speech of all israel has come to the king to return him to his house 
you are my brothers you are my bone and my flesh why then are you the last to bring back the king ? 
say to amasa aren t you my bone and my flesh ? god do so to me and more also if you aren t captain of the army before me continually in the room of joab 
he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as one man so that they sent to the king saying return you and all your servants 
so the king returned and came to the jordan judah came to gilgal to go to meet the king to bring the king over the jordan 
shimei the son of gera the benjamite who was of bahurim hurried and came down with the men of judah to meet king david 
there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him and they went through the jordan in the presence of the king 
a ferry boat went to bring over the king s household and to do what he thought good shimei the son of gera fell down before the king when he had come over the jordan 
he said to the king don t let my lord impute iniquity to me nor remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart 
for your servant knows that i have sinned therefore behold i have come this day the first of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king 
but abishai the son of zeruiah answered shall shimei not be put to death for this because he cursed yahweh s anointed ? 
david said what have i to do with you you sons of zeruiah that you should this day be adversaries to me ? shall there any man be put to death this day in israel ? for don t i know that i am this day king over israel ? 
the king said to shimei you shall not die the king swore to him 
mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and he had neither groomed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace 
it happened when he had come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said to him why didn t you go with me mephibosheth ? 
he answered my lord o king my servant deceived me for your servant said i will saddle me a donkey that i may ride thereon and go with the king because your servant is lame 
he has slandered your servant to my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in your eyes 
for all my father s house were but dead men before my lord the king yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table what right therefore have i yet that i should cry any more to the king ? 
the king said to him why do you speak any more of your matters ? i say you and ziba divide the land 
mephibosheth said to the king yes let him take all because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house 
barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and he went over the jordan with the king to conduct him over the jordan 
now barzillai was a very aged man even eighty years old and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for he was a very great man 
the king said to barzillai come over with me and i will sustain you with me in jerusalem 
barzillai said to the king how many are the days of the years of my life that i should go up with the king to jerusalem ?
i am this day eighty years old can i discern between good and bad ? can your servant taste what i eat or what i drink ? can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women ? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king ?
your servant would but just go over the jordan with the king why should the king repay me with such a reward ?
please let your servant turn back again that i may die in my own city by the grave of my father and my mother but behold your servant chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good to you 
the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will do to him that which shall seem good to you whatever you require of me that i will do for you 
all the people went over the jordan and the king went over then the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned to his own place 
so the king went over to gilgal and chimham went over with him all the people of judah brought the king over and also half the people of israel 
behold all the men of israel came to the king and said to the king why have our brothers the men of judah stolen you away and brought the king and his household over the jordan and all david s men with him ? 
all the men of judah answered the men of israel because the king is a close relative to us why then are you angry about this matter ? have we eaten at all at the king s cost ? or has he given us any gift ? 
the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more claim to david than you why then did you despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king ? the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel 
there happened to be there a base fellow whose name was sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew the trumpet and said we have no portion in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to his tents israel ! 
so all the men of israel went up from following david and followed sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah joined with their king from the jordan even to jerusalem 
david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in custody and provided them with sustenance but didn t go in to them so they were shut up to the day of their death living in widowhood 
then the king said to amasa call me the men of judah together within three days and be here present 
so amasa went to call the men of judah together but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him 
david said to abishai now sheba the son of bichri will do us more harm than absalom did take your lord s servants and pursue after him lest he get himself fortified cities and escape out of our sight 
there went out after him joab s men and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri 
when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa came to meet them joab was clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on and on it was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath and as he went forth it fell out 
joab said to amasa is it well with you my brother ? joab took amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him 
but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joab s hand so he struck him with it in the body and shed out his bowels to the ground and didn t strike him again and he died joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri 
there stood by him one of joab s young men and said he who favors joab and he who is for david let him follow joab ! 
amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway when the man saw that all the people stood still he carried amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a garment over him when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still 
when he was removed out of the highway all the people went on after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri 
he went through all the tribes of israel to abel and to beth maacah and all the berites and they were gathered together and went also after him 
they came and besieged him in abel of beth maacah and they cast up a mound against the city and it stood against the rampart and all the people who were with joab battered the wall to throw it down 
then a wise woman cried out of the city hear hear ! please say to joab come near here that i may speak with you 
he came near to her and the woman said are you joab ? he answered i am then she said to him hear the words of your handmaid he answered i do hear 
then she spoke saying they were used to say in old times they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they settled it 
i am among those who are peaceable and faithful in israel you seek to destroy a city and a mother in israel why will you swallow up the inheritance of yahweh ? 
joab answered far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or destroy 
the matter is not so but a man of the hill country of ephraim sheba the son of bichri by name has lifted up his hand against the king even against david deliver him only and i will depart from the city the woman said to joab behold his head shall be thrown to you over the wall 
then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and threw it out to joab he blew the trumpet and they were dispersed from the city every man to his tent joab returned to jerusalem to the king 
now joab was over all the army of israel and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites 
and adoram was over the men subject to forced labor and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was the recorder 
there was a famine in the days of david three years year after year and david sought the face of yahweh yahweh said it is for saul and for his bloody house because he put to death the gibeonites 
the king called the gibeonites and said to them now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of the amorites and the children of israel had sworn to them and saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of israel and judah 
and david said to the gibeonites what shall i do for you ? and with what shall i make atonement that you may bless the inheritance of yahweh ? 
the gibeonites said to him it is no matter of silver or gold between us and saul or his house neither is it for us to put any man to death in israel he said whatever you say that will i do for you 
they said to the king the man who consumed us and who devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of israel 
let seven men of his sons be delivered to us and we will hang them up to yahweh in gibeah of saul the chosen of yahweh the king said i will give them 
but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul because of yahweh s oath that was between them between david and jonathan the son of saul 
but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah whom she bore to saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul whom she bore to adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite 
he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the mountain before yahweh and all seven of them fell together they were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days at the beginning of barley harvest 
rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her on the rock from the beginning of harvest until water was poured on them from the sky she allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day nor the animals of the field by night 
it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the concubine of saul had done 
david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabesh gilead who had stolen them from the street of beth shan where the philistines had hanged them in the day that the philistines killed saul in gilboa 
and he brought up from there the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged 
they buried the bones of saul and jonathan his son in the country of benjamin in zela in the tomb of kish his father and they performed all that the king commanded after that god was entreated for the land 
the philistines had war again with israel and david went down and his servants with him and fought against the philistines david grew faint 
and ishbibenob who was of the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight he being armed with a new sword thought to have slain david 
but abishai the son of zeruiah helped him and struck the philistine and killed him then the men of david swore to him saying you shall go no more out with us to battle that you don t quench the lamp of israel 
it came to pass after this that there was again war with the philistines at gob then sibbecai the hushathite killed saph who was of the sons of the giant 
there was again war with the philistines at gob and elhanan the son of jaareoregim the bethlehemite killed goliath the gittite s brother the staff of whose spear was like a weaver s beam 
there was again war at gath where there was a man of great stature who had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant 
when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimei david s brother killed him 
these four were born to the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants 
david spoke to yahweh the words of this song in the day that yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul 
and he said yahweh is my rock my fortress and my deliverer even mine 
god my rock in him i will take refuge my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my savior you save me from violence 
i will call on yahweh who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from my enemies 
for the waves of death surrounded me the floods of ungodliness made me afraid 
the cords of sheol were around me the snares of death caught me 
in my distress i called on yahweh yes i called to my god he heard my voice out of his temple my cry came into his ears 
then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken because he was angry 
smoke went up out of his nostrils fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it 
he bowed the heavens also and came down thick darkness was under his feet 
he rode on a cherub and flew yes he was seen on the wings of the wind 
he made darkness pavilions around himself gathering of waters and thick clouds of the skies 
at the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled 
yahweh thundered from heaven the most high uttered his voice 
he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and confused them 
then the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of yahweh at the blast of the breath of his nostrils 
he sent from on high and he took me he drew me out of many waters 
he delivered me from my strong enemy from those who hated me for they were too mighty for me 
they came on me in the day of my calamity but yahweh was my support 
he also brought me out into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me 
yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness he rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands 
for i have kept the ways of yahweh and have not wickedly departed from my god 
for all his ordinances were before me as for his statutes i did not depart from them 
i was also perfect toward him i kept myself from my iniquity 
therefore yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his eyesight 
with the merciful you will show yourself merciful with the perfect man you will show yourself perfect 
with the pure you will show yourself pure with the crooked you will show yourself shrewd 
you will save the afflicted people but your eyes are on the haughty that you may bring them down 
for you are my lamp yahweh yahweh will light up my darkness 
for by you i run against a troop by my god i leap over a wall 
as for god his way is perfect the word of yahweh is tested he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him 
for who is god besides yahweh ? who is a rock besides our god ?
god is my strong fortress he makes my way perfect 
he makes his feet like hinds feet and sets me on my high places 
he teaches my hands to war so that my arms bend a bow of brass 
you have also given me the shield of your salvation your gentleness has made me great 
you have enlarged my steps under me my feet have not slipped 
i have pursued my enemies and destroyed them i didn t turn again until they were consumed 
i have consumed them and struck them through so that they can t arise yes they have fallen under my feet 
for you have armed me with strength for the battle you have subdued under me those who rose up against me 
you have also made my enemies turn their backs to me that i might cut off those who hate me 
they looked but there was none to save even to yahweh but he didn t answer them 
then i beat them as small as the dust of the earth i crushed them as the mire of the streets and spread them abroad 
you also have delivered me from the strivings of my people you have kept me to be the head of the nations a people whom i have not known will serve me 
the foreigners will submit themselves to me as soon as they hear of me they will obey me 
the foreigners will fade away and will come trembling out of their close places 
yahweh lives ! blessed be my rock ! exalted be god the rock of my salvation 
even the god who executes vengeance for me who brings down peoples under me 
who brings me away from my enemies yes you lift me up above those who rise up against me you deliver me from the violent man 
therefore i will give thanks to you yahweh among the nations will sing praises to your name 
he gives great deliverance to his king and shows loving kindness to his anointed to david and to his seed forevermore 
now these are the last words of david david the son of jesse says the man who was raised on high says the anointed of the god of jacob the sweet psalmist of israel 
 the spirit of yahweh spoke by me his word was on my tongue 
the god of israel said the rock of israel spoke to me one who rules over men righteously who rules in the fear of god 
shall be as the light of the morning when the sun rises a morning without clouds when the tender grass springs out of the earth through clear shining after rain 
most certainly my house is not so with god yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for it is all my salvation and all my desire although he doesn t make it grow 
but all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away because they can t be taken with the hand 
but the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place 
these are the names of the mighty men whom david had josheb basshebeth a tahchemonite chief of the captains the same was adino the eznite against eight hundred slain at one time 
after him was eleazar the son of dodai the son of an ahohite one of the three mighty men with david when they defied the philistines who were there gathered together to battle and the men of israel were gone away 
he arose and struck the philistines until his hand was weary and his hand froze to the sword and yahweh worked a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to take spoil 
after him was shammah the son of agee a hararite the philistines were gathered together into a troop where there was a plot of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the philistines 
but he stood in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the philistines and yahweh worked a great victory 
three of the thirty chief men went down and came to david in the harvest time to the cave of adullam and the troop of the philistines was encamped in the valley of rephaim 
david was then in the stronghold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem 
david longed and said oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate ! 
the three mighty men broke through the army of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david but he would not drink of it but poured it out to yahweh 
he said be it far from me yahweh that i should do this ! isn t it the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives ? therefore he would not drink it the three mighty men did these things 
abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chief of the three he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them and had a name among the three 
wasn t he most honorable of the three ? therefore he was made their captain however he didn t attain to the three 
benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done mighty deeds he killed the two sons of ariel of moab he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow 
he killed an egyptian a goodly man and the egyptian had a spear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptian s hand and killed him with his own spear 
benaiah the son of jehoiada did these things and had a name among the three mighty men 
he was more honorable than the thirty but he didn t attain to the three david set him over his guard 
asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem 
shammah the harodite elika the harodite 
helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite 
abiezer the anathothite mebunnai the hushathite 
zalmon the ahohite maharai the netophathite 
heleb the son of baanah the netophathite ittai the son of ribai of gibeah of the children of benjamin 
benaiah a pirathonite hiddai of the brooks of gaash 
abialbon the arbathite azmaveth the barhumite 
eliahba the shaalbonite the sons of jashen jonathan 
shammah the hararite ahiam the son of sharar the ararite 
eliphelet the son of ahasbai the son of the maacathite eliam the son of ahithophel the gilonite 
hezro the carmelite paarai the arbite 
igal the son of nathan of zobah bani the gadite 
zelek the ammonite naharai the beerothite armor bearers to joab the son of zeruiah 
ira the ithrite gareb the ithrite 
again the anger of yahweh was kindled against israel and he moved david against them saying go number israel and judah 
the king said to joab the captain of the army who was with him now go back and forth through all the tribes of israel from dan even to beersheba and number the people that i may know the sum of the people 
joab said to the king now may yahweh your god add to the people however many they may be one hundred times and may the eyes of my lord the king see it but why does my lord the king delight in this thing ? 
notwithstanding the king s word prevailed against joab and against the captains of the army joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of israel 
they passed over the jordan and encamped in aroer on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of gad and to jazer 
then they came to gilead and to the land of tahtim hodshi and they came to dan jaan and around to sidon 
and came to the stronghold of tyre and to all the cities of the hivites and of the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah at beersheba 
so when they had gone back and forth through all the land they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days 
joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men 
david s heart struck him after that he had numbered the people david said to yahweh i have sinned greatly in that which i have done but now yahweh put away i beg you the iniquity of your servant for i have done very foolishly 
when david rose up in the morning the word of yahweh came to the prophet gad david s seer saying 
 go and speak to david thus says yahweh i offer you three things choose one of them that i may do it to you 
so gad came to david and told him and said to him shall seven years of famine come to you in your land ? or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you ? or shall there be three days pestilence in your land ? now answer and consider what answer i shall return to him who sent me 
david said to gad i am in distress let us fall now into the hand of yahweh for his mercies are great let me not fall into the hand of man 
so yahweh sent a pestilence on israel from the morning even to the appointed time and there died of the people from dan even to beersheba seventy thousand men 
when the angel stretched out his hand toward jerusalem to destroy it yahweh relented of the disaster and said to the angel who destroyed the people it is enough now stay your hand the angel of yahweh was by the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite 
david spoke to yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people and said behold i have sinned and i have done perversely but these sheep what have they done ? please let your hand be against me and against my father s house 
gad came that day to david and said to him go up build an altar to yahweh on the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite 
david went up according to the saying of gad as yahweh commanded 
araunah looked out and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him then araunah went out and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground 
araunah said why has my lord the king come to his servant ? david said to buy your threshing floor to build an altar to yahweh that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people 
araunah said to david let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him behold the cattle for the burnt offering and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood 
all this king does araunah give to the king araunah said to the king may yahweh your god accept you 
the king said to araunah no but i will most certainly buy it from you for a price i will not offer burnt offerings to yahweh my god which cost me nothing so david bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver 
david built an altar to yahweh there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so yahweh was entreated for the land and the plague was stayed from israel 
now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he couldn t keep warm 
therefore his servants said to him let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin let her stand before the king and cherish him and let her lie in your bosom that my lord the king may keep warm 
so they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of israel and found abishag the shunammite and brought her to the king 
the young lady was very beautiful and she cherished the king and ministered to him but the king didn t know her intimately 
he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they following adonijah helped him 
but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men who belonged to david were not with adonijah 
adonijah killed sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of zoheleth which is beside en rogel and he called all his brothers the king s sons and all the men of judah the king s servants 
but nathan the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother he didn t call 
then nathan spoke to bathsheba the mother of solomon saying haven t you heard that adonijah the son of haggith reigns and david our lord doesn t know it ?
now therefore come please let me give you counsel that you may save your own life and the life of your son solomon 
go in to king david and tell him didn t you my lord king swear to your handmaid saying assuredly solomon your son shall reign after me and he shall sit on my throne ? why then does adonijah reign ? 
behold while you yet talk there with the king i also will come in after you and confirm your words 
bathsheba went in to the king into the room the king was very old and abishag the shunammite was ministering to the king 
bathsheba bowed and showed respect to the king the king said what would you like ? 
she said to him my lord you swore by yahweh your god to your handmaid assuredly solomon your son shall reign after me and he shall sit on my throne 
now behold adonijah reigns and you my lord the king don t know it 
he has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance and has called all the sons of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the army but he hasn t called solomon your servant 
you my lord the king the eyes of all israel are on you that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him 
otherwise it will happen when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders 
behold while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophet came in 
they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet ! when he had come in before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground 
nathan said my lord king have you said adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit on my throne ? 
for he is gone down this day and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance and has called all the king s sons and the captains of the army and abiathar the priest behold they are eating and drinking before him and say long live king adonijah ! 
but he hasn t called me even me your servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and your servant solomon 
is this thing done by my lord the king and you haven t shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ? 
then king david answered call to me bathsheba she came into the king s presence and stood before the king 
the king swore and said as yahweh lives who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity 
most certainly as i swore to you by yahweh the god of israel saying assuredly solomon your son shall reign after me and he shall sit on my throne in my place most certainly so will i do this day 
then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and showed respect to the king and said let my lord king david live forever ! 
king david said call to me zadok the priest nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada they came before the king 
the king said to them take with you the servants of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride on my own mule and bring him down to gihon 
let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel blow the trumpet and say long live king solomon ! 
then you shall come up after him and he shall come and sit on my throne for he shall be king in my place i have appointed him to be prince over israel and over judah 
benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said amen may yahweh the god of my lord the king say so 
as yahweh has been with my lord the king even so may he be with solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david 
so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and caused solomon to ride on king david s mule and brought him to gihon 
zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tent and anointed solomon they blew the trumpet and all the people said long live king solomon ! 
all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth shook with their sound 
adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating when joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said why is this noise of the city being in an uproar ? 
while he yet spoke behold jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said come in for you are a worthy man and bring good news 
jonathan answered adonijah most certainly our lord king david has made solomon king 
the king has sent with him zadok the priest nathan the prophet benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they have caused him to ride on the king s mule 
zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon they have come up from there rejoicing so that the city rang again this is the noise that you have heard 
also thus said the king blessed be yahweh the god of israel who has given one to sit on my throne this day my eyes even seeing it 
all the guests of adonijah were afraid and rose up and each man went his way 
adonijah feared because of solomon and he arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar 
it was told solomon saying behold adonijah fears king solomon for behold he has laid hold on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword 
solomon said if he shows himself a worthy man not a hair of him shall fall to the earth but if wickedness be found in him he shall die 
so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar he came and bowed down to king solomon and solomon said to him go to your house 
now the days of david drew near that he should die and he commanded solomon his son saying 
 i am going the way of all the earth you be strong therefore and show yourself a man 
and keep the instruction of yahweh your god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes his commandments his ordinances and his testimonies according to that which is written in the law of moses that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn yourself 
that yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me saying if your children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail you he said a man on the throne of israel 
 moreover you know also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me even what he did to the two captains of the armies of israel to abner the son of ner and to amasa the son of jether whom he killed and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist and in his shoes that were on his feet 
do therefore according to your wisdom and don t let his gray head go down to sheol in peace 
but show kindness to the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be of those who eat at your table for so they came to me when i fled from absalom your brother 
 behold there is with you shimei the son of gera the benjamite of bahurim who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at the jordan and i swore to him by yahweh saying i will not put you to death with the sword 
now therefore don t hold him guiltless for you are a wise man and you will know what you ought to do to him and you shall bring his gray head down to sheol with blood 
david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david 
the days that david reigned over israel were forty years he reigned seven years in hebron and he reigned thirty three years in jerusalem 
solomon sat on the throne of david his father and his kingdom was firmly established 
then adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon she said do you come peaceably ? he said peaceably 
he said moreover i have something to tell you she said say on 
he said you know that the kingdom was mine and that all israel set their faces on me that i should reign however the kingdom is turned around and has become my brother s for it was his from yahweh 
now i ask one petition of you don t deny me she said to him say on 
he said please speak to solomon the king for he will not tell you no that he give me abishag the shunammite as wife 
bathsheba said alright i will speak for you to the king 
bathsheba therefore went to king solomon to speak to him for adonijah the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself to her and sat down on his throne and caused a throne to be set for the king s mother and she sat on his right hand 
then she said i ask one small petition of you don t deny me the king said to her ask on my mother for i will not deny you 
she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah your brother as wife 
king solomon answered his mother why do you ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ? ask for him the kingdom also for he is my elder brother even for him and for abiathar the priest and for joab the son of zeruiah 
then king solomon swore by yahweh saying god do so to me and more also if adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life 
now therefore as yahweh lives who has established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who has made me a house as he promised surely adonijah shall be put to death this day 
king solomon sent by benaiah the son of jehoiada and he fell on him so that he died 
to abiathar the priest the king said go to anathoth to your own fields for you are worthy of death but i will not at this time put you to death because you bore the ark of the lord yahweh before david my father and because you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted 
so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest to yahweh that he might fulfill the word of yahweh which he spoke concerning the house of eli in shiloh 
the news came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah though he didn t turn after absalom joab fled to the tent of yahweh and caught hold on the horns of the altar 
it was told king solomon joab has fled to the tent of yahweh and behold he is by the altar then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall on him 
benaiah came to the tent of yahweh and said to him thus says the king come forth ! he said no but i will die here benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab and thus he answered me 
the king said to him do as he has said and fall on him and bury him that you may take away the blood which joab shed without cause from me and from my father s house 
yahweh will return his blood on his own head because he fell on two men more righteous and better than he and killed them with the sword and my father david didn t know it abner the son of ner captain of the army of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the army of judah 
so shall their blood return on the head of joab and on the head of his seed forever but to david and to his seed and to his house and to his throne there shall be peace forever from yahweh 
then benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell on him and killed him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness 
the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his place over the army and the king put zadok the priest in the place of abiathar 
the king sent and called for shimei and said to him build yourself a house in jerusalem and dwell there and don t go out from there anywhere 
for on the day you go out and pass over the brook kidron know for certain that you shall surely die your blood shall be on your own head 
shimei said to the king the saying is good as my lord the king has said so will your servant do shimei lived in jerusalem many days 
it happened at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away to achish son of maacah king of gath they told shimei saying behold your servants are in gath 
shimei arose and saddled his donkey and went to gath to achish to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from gath 
it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and had come again 
the king sent and called for shimei and said to him didn t i adjure you by yahweh and warn you saying know for certain that on the day you go out and walk abroad any where you shall surely die ? you said to me the saying that i have heard is good 
why then have you not kept the oath of yahweh and the commandment that i have instructed you with ? 
the king said moreover to shimei you know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to that you did to david my father therefore yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head 
but king solomon shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before yahweh forever 
so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada and he went out and fell on him so that he died the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon 
solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaoh s daughter and brought her into the city of david until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of yahweh and the wall of jerusalem all around 
only the people sacrificed in the high places because there was no house built for the name of yahweh until those days 
solomon loved yahweh walking in the statutes of david his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places 
the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar 
in gibeon yahweh appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give you 
solomon said you have shown to your servant david my father great loving kindness according as he walked before you in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with you you have kept for him this great loving kindness that you have given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day 
now yahweh my god you have made your servant king instead of david my father i am but a little child i don t know how to go out or come in 
your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen a great people that can t be numbered nor counted for multitude 
give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people that i may discern between good and evil for who is able to judge this your great people ? 
the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing 
god said to him because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself long life neither have asked riches for yourself nor have asked the life of your enemies but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice 
behold i have done according to your word behold i have given you a wise and an understanding heart so that there has been none like you before you neither after you shall any arise like you 
i have also given you that which you have not asked both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the kings like you all your days 
if you will walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as your father david walked then i will lengthen your days 
solomon awoke and behold it was a dream then he came to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of yahweh and offered up burnt offerings offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servants 
then two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before him 
the one woman said oh my lord i and this woman dwell in one house i delivered a child with her in the house 
it happened the third day after i delivered that this woman delivered also we were together there was no stranger with us in the house just us two in the house 
this woman s child died in the night because she lay on it 
she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while your handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom 
when i rose in the morning to nurse my child behold it was dead but when i had looked at it in the morning behold it was not my son whom i bore 
the other woman said no but the living is my son and the dead is your son this said no but the dead is your son and the living is my son thus they spoke before the king 
then the king said the one says this is my son who lives and your son is the dead and the other says no but your son is the dead one and my son is the living one 
the king said get me a sword they brought a sword before the king 
the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other 
then the woman whose the living child was spoke to the king for her heart yearned over her son and she said oh my lord give her the living child and in no way kill it ! but the other said it shall be neither mine nor yours divide it 
then the king answered give her the living child and in no way kill it she is its mother 
all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do justice 
king solomon was king over all israel 
these were the princes whom he had azariah the son of zadok the priest 
elihoreph and ahijah the sons of shisha scribes jehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder 
and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the army and zadok and abiathar were priests 
and azariah the son of nathan was over the officers and zabud the son of nathan was chief minister the king s friend 
and ahishar was over the household and adoniram the son of abda was over the men subject to forced labor 
solomon had twelve officers over all israel who provided food for the king and his household each man had to make provision for a month in the year 
these are their names ben hur in the hill country of ephraim 
ben deker in makaz and in shaalbim and beth shemesh and elon beth hanan 
ben hesed in arubboth to him belonged socoh and all the land of hepher 
ben abinadab in all the height of dor he had taphath the daughter of solomon as wife 
baana the son of ahilud in taanach and megiddo and all beth shean which is beside zarethan beneath jezreel from beth shean to abel meholah as far as beyond jokmeam 
ben geber in ramoth gilead to him belonged the towns of jair the son of manasseh which are in gilead to him belonged the region of argob which is in bashan sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars 
ahinadab the son of iddo in mahanaim 
ahimaaz in naphtali he also took basemath the daughter of solomon as wife 
baana the son of hushai in asher and bealoth 
jehoshaphat the son of paruah in issachar 
shimei the son of ela in benjamin 
geber the son of uri in the land of gilead the country of sihon king of the amorites and of og king of bashan and he was the only officer who was in the land 
judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude eating and drinking and making merry 
solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the river to the land of the philistines and to the border of egypt they brought tribute and served solomon all the days of his life 
for he had dominion over all on this side the river from tiphsah even to gaza over all the kings on this side the river and he had peace on all sides around him 
judah and israel lived safely every man under his vine and under his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days of solomon 
solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen 
those officers provided food for king solomon and for all who came to king solomon s table every man in his month they let nothing be lacking 
barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where the officers were every man according to his duty 
god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and very great understanding even as the sand that is on the seashore 
solomon s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of egypt 
for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and heman and calcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in all the nations all around 
he spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs were one thousand five 
he spoke of trees from the cedar that is in lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall he spoke also of animals and of birds and of creeping things and of fish 
there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of solomon from all kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom 
hiram king of tyre sent his servants to solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father for hiram was ever a lover of david 
solomon sent to hiram saying 
 you know how that david my father could not build a house for the name of yahweh his god for the wars which were about him on every side until yahweh put them under the soles of his feet 
but now yahweh my god has given me rest on every side there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence 
behold i purpose to build a house for the name of yahweh my god as yahweh spoke to david my father saying your son whom i will set on your throne in your place he shall build the house for my name 
now therefore command that they cut me cedar trees out of lebanon my servants shall be with your servants and i will give you wages for your servants according to all that you shall say for you know that there is not among us any who knows how to cut timber like the sidonians 
it happened when hiram heard the words of solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said blessed is yahweh this day who has given to david a wise son over this great people 
hiram sent to solomon saying i have heard the message which you have sent to me i will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir 
my servants shall bring them down from lebanon to the sea i will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you shall appoint me and will cause them to be broken up there and you shall receive them you shall accomplish my desire in giving food for my household 
so hiram gave solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire 
solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil solomon gave this to hiram year by year 
yahweh gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a treaty together 
king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy was thirty thousand men 
he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor 
solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains 
besides solomon s chief officers who were over the work three thousand and three hundred who bore rule over the people who labored in the work 
the king commanded and they cut out great stones costly stones to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone 
solomon s builders and hiram s builders and the gebalites cut them and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house 
it happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel had come out of the land of egypt in the fourth year of solomon s reign over israel in the month ziv which is the second month that he began to build the house of yahweh 
the house which king solomon built for yahweh its length was sixty cubits and its breadth twenty and its height thirty cubits 
the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was its length according to the breadth of the house ten cubits was its breadth before the house 
for the house he made windows of fixed lattice work 
against the wall of the house he built stories all around against the walls of the house all around both of the temple and of the oracle and he made side rooms all around 
the nethermost story was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house 
the house when it was in building was built of stone prepared at the quarry and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building 
the door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story and out of the middle into the third 
so he built the house and finished it and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar 
he built the stories against all the house each five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar 
the word of yahweh came to solomon saying 
 concerning this house which you are building if you will walk in my statutes and execute my ordinances and keep all my commandments to walk in them then will i establish my word with you which i spoke to david your father 
i will dwell among the children of israel and will not forsake my people israel 
so solomon built the house and finished it 
he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling he covered them on the inside with wood and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir 
he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling he built them for it within for an oracle even for the most holy place 
in front of the temple sanctuary was forty cubits 
there was cedar on the house within carved with buds and open flowers all was cedar there was no stone seen 
he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within to set there the ark of the covenant of yahweh 
within the oracle was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in its height and he overlaid it with pure gold and he covered the altar with cedar 
so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle and he overlaid it with gold 
the whole house he overlaid with gold until all the house was finished also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold 
in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood each ten cubits high 
he set the cherubim within the inner house and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house 
he overlaid the cherubim with gold 
he carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers inside and outside 
the floor of the house he overlaid with gold inside and outside 
for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood the lintel and door posts were a fifth part of the wall 
so he made two doors of olive wood and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and he spread the gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees 
so also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood out of a fourth part of the wall 
and two doors of fir wood the two leaves of the one door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding 
he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work 
he built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and a course of cedar beams 
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of yahweh laid in the month ziv 
in the eleventh year in the month bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all its parts and according to all its fashion so was he seven years in building it 
solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he finished all his house 
for he built the house of the forest of lebanon its length was one hundred cubits and its breadth fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits on four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars 
it was covered with cedar above over the forty five beams that were on the pillars fifteen in a row 
there were beams in three rows and window was over against window in three ranks 
all the doors and posts were made square with beams and window was over against window in three ranks 
he made the porch of pillars its length was fifty cubits and its breadth thirty cubits and a porch before them and pillars and a threshold before them 
he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge even the porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor 
his house where he was to dwell the other court within the porch was of the like work he made also a house for pharaoh s daughter whom solomon had taken as wife like this porch 
all these were of costly stones even of cut stone according to measure sawed with saws inside and outside even from the foundation to the coping and so on the outside to the great court 
the foundation was of costly stones even great stones stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits 
above were costly stones even cut stone according to measure and cedar wood 
the great court around had three courses of cut stone and a course of cedar beams like as the inner court of the house of yahweh and the porch of the house 
king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre 
he was the son of a widow of the tribe of naphtali and his father was a man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill to work all works in brass he came to king solomon and performed all his work 
for he fashioned the two pillars of brass eighteen cubits high apiece and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them about 
he made two capitals of molten brass to set on the tops of the pillars the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits 
there were nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital 
so he made the pillars and there were two rows around on the one network to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars and he did so for the other capital 
the capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work four cubits 
there were capitals above also on the two pillars close by the belly which was beside the network and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows around on the other capital 
he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple and he set up the right pillar and called its name jachin and he set up the left pillar and called its name boaz 
on the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work of the pillars finished 
he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and its height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits encircled it 
under its brim around there were buds which encircled it for ten cubits encircling the sea the buds were in two rows cast when it was cast 
it stood on twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set on them above and all their hinder parts were inward 
it was a handbreadth thick and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup like the flower of a lily it held two thousand baths 
he made the ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits its breadth and three cubits its height 
the work of the bases was like this they had panels and there were panels between the ledges 
and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubim and on the ledges there was a pedestal above and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work 
every base had four bronze wheels and axles of brass and the four feet of it had supports beneath the basin were the supports molten with wreaths at the side of each 
the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit and its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal a cubit and a half and also on its mouth were engravings and their panels were foursquare not round 
the four wheels were underneath the panels and the axles of the wheels were in the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit 
the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel their axles and their rims and their spokes and their naves were all molten 
there were four supports at the four corners of each base its supports were of the base itself 
in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same 
on the plates of its stays and on its panels he engraved cherubim lions and palm trees according to the space of each with wreaths all around 
in this way he made the ten bases all of them had one casting one measure and one form 
he made ten basins of brass one basin contained forty baths and every basin was four cubits and on every one of the ten bases one basin 
he set the bases five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward toward the south 
thus all the work that king solomon worked in the house of yahweh was finished solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated the silver and the gold and the vessels and put them in the treasuries of the house of yahweh 
then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the princes of the fathers households of the children of israel to king solomon in jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of yahweh out of the city of david which is zion 
all the men of israel assembled themselves to king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim which is the seventh month 
all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the ark 
they brought up the ark of yahweh and the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels that were in the tent even these the priests and the levites brought up 
king solomon and all the congregation of israel who were assembled to him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude 
the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of yahweh to its place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubim 
for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above 
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle but they were not seen outside and there they are to this day 
there was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone which moses put there at horeb when yahweh made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt 
it came to pass when the priests had come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of yahweh 
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of yahweh filled the house of yahweh 
then solomon said yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness 
i have surely built you a house of habitation a place for you to dwell in forever 
the king turned his face about and blessed all the assembly of israel and all the assembly of israel stood 
he said blessed is yahweh the god of israel who spoke with his mouth to david your father and has with his hand fulfilled it saying 
 since the day that i brought my people israel out of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build a house that my name might be there but i chose david to be over my people israel 
 now it was in the heart of david my father to build a house for the name of yahweh the god of israel 
but yahweh said to david my father whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name you did well that it was in your heart 
nevertheless you shall not build the house but your son who shall come forth out of your body he shall build the house for my name 
yahweh has established his word that he spoke for i have risen up in the place of david my father and i sit on the throne of israel as yahweh promised and have built the house for the name of yahweh the god of israel 
there i have set a place for the ark in which is the covenant of yahweh which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of egypt 
solomon stood before the altar of yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven 
and he said yahweh the god of israel there is no god like you in heaven above or on earth beneath who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants who walk before you with all their heart 
who have kept with your servant david my father that which you promised him yes you spoke with your mouth and have fulfilled it with your hand as it is this day 
now therefore may yahweh the god of israel keep with your servant david my father that which you have promised him saying there shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel if only your children take heed to their way to walk before me as you have walked before me 
 now therefore god of israel please let your word be verified which you spoke to your servant david my father 
but will god in very deed dwell on the earth ? behold heaven and the heaven of heavens can t contain you how much less this house that i have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant and for his supplication yahweh my god to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day 
that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day even toward the place of which you have said my name shall be there to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place 
listen to the supplication of your servant and of your people israel when they shall pray toward this place yes hear in heaven your dwelling place and when you hear forgive 
 if a man sins against his neighbor and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear and he comes and swear before your altar in this house 
then hear in heaven and do and judge your servants condemning the wicked to bring his way on his own head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness 
 when your people israel are struck down before the enemy because they have sinned against you if they turn again to you and confess your name and pray and make supplication to you in this house 
then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people israel and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers 
 when the sky is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you if they pray toward this place and confess your name and turn from their sin when you afflict them 
then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and of your people israel when you teach them the good way in which they should walk and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for an inheritance 
 if there is famine in the land if there is pestilence if there is blight mildew locust or caterpillar if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities whatever plague whatever sickness there is 
whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man or by all your people israel who shall each know the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house 
then hear in heaven your dwelling place and forgive and do and render to every man according to all his ways whose heart you know for you even you only know the hearts of all the children of men 
that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers 
hear in heaven your dwelling place and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for that all the peoples of the earth may know your name to fear you as do your people israel and that they may know that this house which i have built is called by your name 
 if your people go out to battle against their enemy by whatever way you shall send them and they pray to yahweh toward the city which you have chosen and toward the house which i have built for your name 
then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause 
if they sin against you for there is no man who doesn t sin and you are angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy far off or near 
yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive and turn again and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive saying we have sinned and have done perversely we have dealt wickedly 
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them captive and pray to you toward their land which you gave to their fathers the city which you have chosen and the house which i have built for your name 
then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven your dwelling place and maintain their cause 
and forgive your people who have sinned against you and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you and give them compassion before those who carried them captive that they may have compassion on them
 for they are your people and your inheritance which you brought out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron 
that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant and to the supplication of your people israel to listen to them whenever they cry to you 
for you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be your inheritance as you spoke by moses your servant when you brought our fathers out of egypt lord yahweh 
it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to yahweh he arose from before the altar of yahweh from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven 
he stood and blessed all the assembly of israel with a loud voice saying 
 blessed be yahweh who has given rest to his people israel according to all that he promised there has not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by moses his servant 
may yahweh our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake us 
that he may incline our hearts to him to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances which he commanded our fathers 
let these my words with which i have made supplication before yahweh be near to yahweh our god day and night that he may maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel as every day shall require 
that all the peoples of the earth may know that yahweh he is god there is none else 
 let your heart therefore be perfect with yahweh our god to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day 
the king and all israel with him offered sacrifice before yahweh 
solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings which he offered to yahweh two and twenty thousand head of cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of yahweh 
the same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before the house of yahweh for there he offered the burnt offering and the meal offering and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar that was before yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering and the meal offering and the fat of the peace offerings 
so solomon held the feast at that time and all israel with him a great assembly from the entrance of hamath to the brook of egypt before yahweh our god seven days and seven days even fourteen days 
on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that yahweh had shown to david his servant and to israel his people 
it happened when solomon had finished the building of the house of yahweh and the king s house and all solomon s desire which he was pleased to do 
that yahweh appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared to him at gibeon 
yahweh said to him i have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before me i have made this house holy which you have built to put my name there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually 
as for you if you will walk before me as david your father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i have commanded you and will keep my statutes and my ordinances 
then i will establish the throne of your kingdom over israel forever according as i promised to david your father saying there shall not fail you a man on the throne of israel 
but if you turn away from following me you or your children and not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but shall go and serve other gods and worship them 
then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have made holy for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples 
though this house is so high yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why has yahweh done thus to this land and to this house ? 
it happened at the end of twenty years in which solomon had built the two houses the house of yahweh and the king s house
 now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee 
hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him and they didn t please him 
he said what cities are these which you have given me my brother ? he called them the land of cabul to this day 
hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold 
this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised to build the house of yahweh and his own house and millo and the wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer 
pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the canaanites who lived in the city and given it for a portion to his daughter solomon s wife 
solomon built gezer and beth horon the lower 
and baalath and tamar in the wilderness in the land 
and all the storage cities that solomon had and the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build for his pleasure in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion 
as for all the people who were left of the amorites the hittites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites who were not of the children of israel 
their children who were left after them in the land whom the children of israel were not able utterly to destroy of them solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day 
but of the children of israel solomon made no bondservants but they were the men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen 
these were the chief officers who were over solomon s work five hundred fifty who bore rule over the people who labored in the work 
but pharaoh s daughter came up out of the city of david to her house which solomon had built for her then he built millo 
solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to yahweh three times a year burning incense with them on the altar that was before yahweh so he finished the house 
king solomon made a navy of ships in ezion geber which is beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom 
hiram sent in the navy his servants sailors who had knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon 
they came to ophir and fetched from there gold four hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon 
when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of yahweh she came to prove him with hard questions 
she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bore spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she had come to solomon she talked with him of all that was in her heart 
solomon told her all her questions there was not anything hidden from the king which he didn t tell her 
when the queen of sheba had seen all the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built 
and the food of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their clothing and his cup bearers and his ascent by which he went up to the house of yahweh there was no more spirit in her 
she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom 
however i didn t believe the words until i came and my eyes had seen it behold the half was not told me ! your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which i heard 
happy are your men happy are these your servants who stand continually before you who hear your wisdom 
blessed is yahweh your god who delighted in you to set you on the throne of israel because yahweh loved israel forever therefore made he you king to do justice and righteousness 
she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon 
the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones 
the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of yahweh and for the king s house harps also and stringed instruments for the singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen to this day 
king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatever she asked besides that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty so she turned and went to her own land she and her servants 
now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred sixty six talents of gold 
besides that which the traders brought and the traffic of the merchants and of all the kings of the mixed people and of the governors of the country 
king solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler 
he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three minas of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon 
moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the finest gold 
there were six steps to the throne and the top of the throne was round behind and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat and two lions standing beside the stays 
twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps there was nothing like it made in any kingdom 
all king solomon s drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon 
for the king had at sea a navy of tarshish with the navy of hiram once every three years came the navy of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks 
so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom 
all the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart 
they brought every man his tribute vessels of silver and vessels of gold and clothing and armor and spices horses and mules a rate year by year 
solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem 
the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland for abundance 
the horses which solomon had were brought out of egypt and the king s merchants received them in droves each drove at a price 
a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for one hundred fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria they brought them out by their means 
now king solomon loved many foreign women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites sidonians and hittites 
of the nations concerning which yahweh said to the children of israel you shall not go among them neither shall they come among you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon joined to these in love 
he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart 
for it happened when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with yahweh his god as was the heart of david his father 
for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the sidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites 
solomon did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh and didn t go fully after yahweh as did david his father 
then solomon built a high place for chemosh the abomination of moab on the mountain that is before jerusalem and for molech the abomination of the children of ammon 
so he did for all his foreign wives who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods 
yahweh was angry with solomon because his heart was turned away from yahweh the god of israel who had appeared to him twice 
and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he didn t keep that which yahweh commanded 
therefore yahweh said to solomon because this is done by you and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes which i have commanded you i will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant 
notwithstanding i will not do it in your days for david your father s sake but i will tear it out of the hand of your son 
however i will not tear away all the kingdom but i will give one tribe to your son for david my servant s sake and for jerusalem s sake which i have chosen 
yahweh raised up an adversary to solomon hadad the edomite he was of the king s seed in edom 
for it happened when david was in edom and joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain and had struck every male in edom
 for joab and all israel remained there six months until he had cut off every male in edom 
that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his father s servants with him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child 
they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took men with them out of paran and they came to egypt to pharaoh king of egypt who gave him a house and appointed him food and gave him land 
hadad found great favor in the sight of pharaoh so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes the queen 
the sister of tahpenes bore him genubath his son whom tahpenes weaned in pharaoh s house and genubath was in pharaoh s house among the sons of pharaoh 
when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers and that joab the captain of the army was dead hadad said to pharaoh let me depart that i may go to my own country 
then pharaoh said to him but what have you lacked with me that behold you seek to go to your own country ? he answered nothing however only let me depart 
god raised up an adversary to him rezon the son of eliada who had fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah 
he gathered men to him and became captain over a troop when david killed them of zobah and they went to damascus and lived therein and reigned in damascus 
he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon besides the mischief of hadad and he abhorred israel and reigned over syria 
jeroboam the son of nebat an ephraimite of zeredah a servant of solomon whose mother s name was zeruah a widow he also lifted up his hand against the king 
this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king solomon built millo and repaired the breach of the city of david his father 
the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valor and solomon saw the young man that he was industrious and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of joseph 
it happened at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way now ahijah had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the field 
ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him and tore it in twelve pieces 
he said to jeroboam take ten pieces for thus says yahweh the god of israel behold i will tear the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes to you
 but he shall have one tribe for my servant david s sake and for jerusalem s sake the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel 
because that they have forsaken me and have worshiped ashtoreth the goddess of the sidonians chemosh the god of moab and milcom the god of the children of ammon they have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in my eyes and to keep my statutes and my ordinances as david his father did 
 however i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servant s sake whom i chose who kept my commandments and my statutes 
but i will take the kingdom out of his son s hand and will give it to you even ten tribes 
to his son will i give one tribe that david my servant may have a lamp always before me in jerusalem the city which i have chosen me to put my name there 
i will take you and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires and shall be king over israel 
it shall be if you will listen to all that i command you and will walk in my ways and do that which is right in my eyes to keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i will be with you and will build you a sure house as i built for david and will give israel to you 
i will for this afflict the seed of david but not forever 
solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam but jeroboam arose and fled into egypt to shishak king of egypt and was in egypt until the death of solomon 
now the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did and his wisdom aren t they written in the book of the acts of solomon ?
the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years 
solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his place 
rehoboam went to shechem for all israel had come to shechem to make him king 
it happened when jeroboam the son of nebat heard of it for he was yet in egypt where he had fled from the presence of king solomon and jeroboam lived in egypt 
and they sent and called him that jeroboam and all the assembly of israel came and spoke to rehoboam saying 
 your father made our yoke grievous now therefore make you the grievous service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us lighter and we will serve you 
he said to them depart for three days then come back to me the people departed 
king rehoboam took counsel with the old men who had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? 
they spoke to him saying if you will be a servant to this people this day and will serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be your servants forever 
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him who stood before him 
he said to them what counsel do you give that we may return answer to this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? 
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him saying thus you shall tell this people who spoke to you saying your father made our yoke heavy but make it lighter to us you shall say to them my little finger is thicker than my father s waist 
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions 
so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king asked saying come to me again the third day 
the king answered the people roughly and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him 
and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions 
so the king didn t listen to the people for it was a thing brought about of yahweh that he might establish his word which yahweh spoke by ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat 
when all israel saw that the king didn t listen to them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david ? neither do we have an inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents israel ! now see to your own house david so israel departed to their tents 
but as for the children of israel who lived in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them 
then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the men subject to forced labor and all israel stoned him to death with stones king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem 
so israel rebelled against the house of david to this day 
it happened when all israel heard that jeroboam was returned that they sent and called him to the congregation and made him king over all israel there was none who followed the house of david but the tribe of judah only 
when rehoboam had come to jerusalem he assembled all the house of judah and the tribe of benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors to fight against the house of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon 
but the word of god came to shemaiah the man of god saying 
 speak to rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all the house of judah and benjamin and to the rest of the people saying 
 thus says yahweh you shall not go up nor fight against your brothers the children of israel everyone return to his house for this thing is of me so they listened to the word of yahweh and returned and went their way according to the word of yahweh 
then jeroboam built shechem in the hill country of ephraim and lived in it and he went out from there and built penuel 
whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and he said to them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem look and see your gods israel which brought you up out of the land of egypt ! 
he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan 
this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even to dan 
he made houses of high places and made priests from among all the people who were not of the sons of levi 
jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like the feast that is in judah and he went up to the altar he did so in bethel sacrificing to the calves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of the high places that he had made 
he went up to the altar which he had made in bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and he ordained a feast for the children of israel and went up to the altar to burn incense 
behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of yahweh to beth el and jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense 
he cried against the altar by the word of yahweh and said altar altar thus says yahweh behold a son shall be born to the house of david josiah by name on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you and they will burn men s bones on you 
he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which yahweh has spoken behold the altar will be split apart and the ashes that are on it will be poured out 
it happened when the king heard the saying of the man of god which he cried against the altar in bethel that jeroboam put out his hand from the altar saying seize him ! his hand which he put out against him dried up so that he could not draw it back again to himself 
the altar also was split apart and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of yahweh 
the king answered the man of god now entreat the favor of yahweh your god and pray for me that my hand may be restored me again the man of god entreated yahweh and the king s hand was restored him again and became as it was before 
the king said to the man of god come home with me and refresh yourself and i will give you a reward 
the man of god said to the king even if you gave me half of your house i would not go in with you neither would i eat bread nor drink water in this place 
for so was it commanded me by the word of yahweh saying you shall eat no bread nor drink water neither return by the way that you came 
so he went another way and didn t return by the way that he came to bethel 
now there lived an old prophet in bethel and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king 
their father said to them which way did he go ? now his sons had seen which way the man of god went who came from judah 
he said to his sons saddle the donkey for me so they saddled the donkey for him and he rode on it 
he went after the man of god and found him sitting under an oak he said to him are you the man of god who came from judah ? he said i am 
then he said to him come home with me and eat bread 
he said i may not return with you nor go in with you neither will i eat bread nor drink water with you in this place 
for it was said to me by the word of yahweh you shall eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that you came 
he said to him i also am a prophet as you are and an angel spoke to me by the word of yahweh saying bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water he lied to him 
so he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water 
it happened as they sat at the table that the word of yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back 
and he cried to the man of god who came from judah saying thus says yahweh because you have been disobedient to the mouth of yahweh and have not kept the commandment which yahweh your god commanded you 
but came back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you eat no bread and drink no water your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers 
it happened after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back 
when he had gone a lion met him by the way and killed him his body was cast in the way and the donkey stood by it the lion also stood by the body 
behold men passed by and saw the body cast in the way and the lion standing by the body and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived 
when the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it he said it is the man of god who was disobedient to the mouth of yahweh therefore yahweh has delivered him to the lion which has mauled him and slain him according to the word of yahweh which he spoke to him 
he spoke to his sons saying saddle the donkey for me they saddled it 
he went and found his body cast in the way and the donkey and the lion standing by the body the lion had not eaten the body nor mauled the donkey 
the prophet took up the body of the man of god and laid it on the donkey and brought it back he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn and to bury him 
he laid his body in his own grave and they mourned over him saying alas my brother ! 
it happened after he had buried him that he spoke to his sons saying when i am dead then bury me in the tomb in which the man of god is buried lay my bones beside his bones 
for the saying which he cried by the word of yahweh against the altar in bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria will surely happen 
after this thing jeroboam didn t return from his evil way but again made priests of the high places from among all the people whoever wanted to he consecrated him that there might be priests of the high places 
this thing became sin to the house of jeroboam even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth 
at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick 
jeroboam said to his wife please get up and disguise yourself that you won t be recognized as the wife of jeroboam go to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet who spoke concerning me that i should be king over this people 
take with you ten loaves and cakes and a jar of honey and go to him he will tell you what will become of the child 
jeroboam s wife did so and arose and went to shiloh and came to the house of ahijah now ahijah could not see for his eyes were set by reason of his age 
yahweh said to ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam comes to inquire of you concerning her son for he is sick thus and thus you shall tell her for it will be when she comes in that she will pretend to be another woman 
it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door that he said come in you wife of jeroboam ! why do you pretend to be another ? for i am sent to you with heavy news 
go tell jeroboam thus says yahweh the god of israel because i exalted you from among the people and made you prince over my people israel 
and tore the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it you and yet you have not been as my servant david who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in my eyes 
but have done evil above all who were before you and have gone and made you other gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and have cast me behind your back 
therefore behold i will bring evil on the house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall he who is shut up and he who is left at large in israel and will utterly sweep away the house of jeroboam as a man sweeps away dung until it is all gone 
he who dies of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat for yahweh has spoken it 
arise therefore and go to your house when your feet enter into the city the child shall die 
all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some good thing toward yahweh the god of israel in the house of jeroboam 
moreover yahweh will raise him up a king over israel who shall cut off the house of jeroboam this is day ! what ? even now 
for yahweh will strike israel as a reed is shaken in the water and he will root up israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers and will scatter them beyond the river because they have made their asherim provoking yahweh to anger 
he will give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam which he has sinned and with which he has made israel to sin 
jeroboam s wife arose and departed and came to tirzah as she came to the threshold of the house the child died 
all israel buried him and mourned for him according to the word of yahweh which he spoke by his servant ahijah the prophet 
the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 
the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years and he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his place 
rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah rehoboam was forty one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mother s name was naamah the ammonitess 
judah did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed above all that their fathers had done 
for they also built them high places and pillars and asherim on every high hill and under every green tree 
and there were also sodomites in the land they did according to all the abominations of the nations which yahweh drove out before the children of israel 
it happened in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem 
and he took away the treasures of the house of yahweh and the treasures of the king s house he even took away all and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made 
king rehoboam made in their place shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who kept the door of the king s house 
it was so that as often as the king went into the house of yahweh the guard bore them and brought them back into the guard room 
now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all that he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam continually 
rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and his mother s name was naamah the ammonitess abijam his son reigned in his place 
now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat began abijam to reign over judah 
he reigned three years in jerusalem and his mother s name was maacah the daughter of abishalom 
he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not perfect with yahweh his god as the heart of david his father 
nevertheless for david s sake yahweh his god gave him a lamp in jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish jerusalem 
because david did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh and didn t turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life except only in the matter of uriah the hittite 
now there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life 
the rest of the acts of abijam and all that he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ? there was war between abijam and jeroboam 
abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his place 
in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel began asa to reign over judah 
he reigned forty one years in jerusalem and his mother s name was maacah the daughter of abishalom 
asa did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh as did david his father 
he put away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made 
also maacah his mother he removed from being queen because she had made an abominable image for an asherah and asa cut down her image and burnt it at the brook kidron 
but the high places were not taken away nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect with yahweh all his days 
he brought into the house of yahweh the things that his father had dedicated and the things that himself had dedicated silver and gold and vessels 
there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days 
baasha king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to asa king of judah 
then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of yahweh and the treasures of the king s house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king asa sent them to ben hadad the son of tabrimmon the son of hezion king of syria who lived at damascus saying 
 there is a treaty between me and you between my father and your father behold i have sent to you a present of silver and gold go break your treaty with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me 
ben hadad listened to king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and struck ijon and dan and abel beth maacah and all chinneroth with all the land of naphtali 
it happened when baasha heard of it that he left off building ramah and lived in tirzah 
then king asa made a proclamation to all judah none was exempted and they carried away the stones of ramah and its timber with which baasha had built and king asa built therewith geba of benjamin and mizpah 
now the rest of all the acts of asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ? but in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet 
asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place 
nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah and he reigned over israel two years 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh and walked in the way of his father and in his sin with which he made israel to sin 
baasha the son of ahijah of the house of issachar conspired against him and baasha struck him at gibbethon which belonged to the philistines for nadab and all israel were laying siege to gibbethon 
even in the third year of asa king of judah baasha killed him and reigned in his place 
it happened that as soon as he was king he struck all the house of jeroboam he didn t leave to jeroboam any who breathed until he had destroyed him according to the saying of yahweh which he spoke by his servant ahijah the shilonite 
for the sins of jeroboam which he sinned and with which he made israel to sin because of his provocation with which he provoked yahweh the god of israel to anger 
now the rest of the acts of nadab and all that he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days 
in the third year of asa king of judah baasha the son of ahijah began to reign over all israel in tirzah for twenty four years 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh and walked in the way of jeroboam and in his sin with which he made israel to sin 
the word of yahweh came to jehu the son of hanani against baasha saying 
 because i exalted you out of the dust and made you prince over my people israel and you have walked in the way of jeroboam and have made my people israel to sin to provoke me to anger with their sins 
behold i will utterly sweep away baasha and his house and i will make your house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat 
the dogs will eat baasha s descendants who die in the city and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat 
now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his might aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in tirzah and elah his son reigned in his place 
moreover by the prophet jehu the son of hanani came the word of yahweh against baasha and against his house both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of yahweh to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of jeroboam and because he struck him 
in the twenty sixth year of asa king of judah elah the son of baasha began to reign over israel in tirzah for two years 
his servant zimri captain of half his chariots conspired against him now he was in tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of arza who was over the household in tirzah 
and zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his place 
it happened when he began to reign as soon as he sat on his throne that he struck all the house of baasha he didn t leave him a single one who urinates on a wall neither of his relatives nor of his friends 
thus zimri destroyed all the house of baasha according to the word of yahweh which he spoke against baasha by jehu the prophet 
for all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son which they sinned and with which they made israel to sin to provoke yahweh the god of israel to anger with their vanities 
now the rest of the acts of elah and all that he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
in the twenty seventh year of asa king of judah zimri reigned seven days in tirzah now the people were encamped against gibbethon which belonged to the philistines 
the people who were encamped heard say zimri has conspired and has also struck the king therefore all israel made omri the captain of the army king over israel that day in the camp 
omri went up from gibbethon and all israel with him and they besieged tirzah 
it happened when zimri saw that the city was taken that he went into the castle of the king s house and burnt the king s house over him with fire and died 
for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of yahweh in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make israel to sin 
now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that he committed aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
then were the people of israel divided into two parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath to make him king and half followed omri 
but the people who followed omri prevailed against the people who followed tibni the son of ginath so tibni died and omri reigned 
in the thirty first year of asa king of judah omri began to reign over israel for twelve years he reigned six years in tirzah 
he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver and he built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shemer the owner of the hill samaria 
omri did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh and dealt wickedly above all who were before him 
for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat and in his sins with which he made israel to sin to provoke yahweh the god of israel to anger with their vanities 
now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might that he showed aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
so omri slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his place 
in the thirty eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty two years 
ahab the son of omri did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh above all that were before him 
it happened as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took as wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the sidonians and went and served baal and worshiped him 
he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had built in samaria 
ahab made the asherah and ahab did yet more to provoke yahweh the god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel who were before him 
in his days hiel the bethelite built jericho he laid its foundation with the loss of abiram his firstborn and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son segub according to the word of yahweh which he spoke by joshua the son of nun 
elijah the tishbite who was of the foreigners of gilead said to ahab as yahweh the god of israel lives before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word 
the word of yahweh came to him saying 
 go away from here turn eastward and hide yourself by the brook cherith that is before the jordan 
it shall be that you shall drink of the brook i have commanded the ravens to feed you there 
so he went and did according to the word of yahweh for he went and lived by the brook cherith that is before the jordan 
the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook 
it happened after a while that the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land 
the word of yahweh came to him saying 
 arise go to zarephath which belongs to sidon and stay there behold i have commanded a widow there to sustain you 
so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold a widow was there gathering sticks and he called to her and said please get me a little water in a vessel that i may drink 
as she was going to get it he called to her and said please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand 
she said as yahweh your god lives i don t have a cake but a handful of meal in the jar and a little oil in the jar behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and bake it for me and my son that we may eat it and die 
elijah said to her don t be afraid go and do as you have said but make me of it a little cake first and bring it out to me and afterward make some for you and for your son 
for thus says yahweh the god of israel the jar of meal shall not empty neither shall the jar of oil fail until the day that yahweh sends rain on the earth 
she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house ate many days 
the jar of meal didn t empty neither did the jar of oil fail according to the word of yahweh which he spoke by elijah 
it happened after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him 
she said to elijah what have i to do with you you man of god ? you have come to me to bring my sin to memory and to kill my son ! 
he said to her give me your son he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into the room where he stayed and laid him on his own bed 
he cried to yahweh and said yahweh my god have you also brought evil on the widow with whom i stay by killing her son ? 
he stretched himself on the child three times and cried to yahweh and said yahweh my god please let this child s soul come into him again 
yahweh listened to the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived 
elijah took the child and brought him down out of the room into the house and delivered him to his mother and elijah said behold your son lives 
the woman said to elijah now i know that you are a man of god and that the word of yahweh in your mouth is truth 
it happened after many days that the word of yahweh came to elijah in the third year saying go show yourself to ahab and i will send rain on the earth 
elijah went to show himself to ahab the famine was severe in samaria 
ahab called obadiah who was over the household now obadiah feared yahweh greatly 
for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of yahweh that obadiah took one hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water 
ahab said to obadiah go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive that we not lose all the animals 
so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself 
as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he recognized him and fell on his face and said is it you my lord elijah ? 
he answered him it is i go tell your lord behold elijah is here ! 
he said wherein have i sinned that you would deliver your servant into the hand of ahab to kill me ?
as yahweh your god lives there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you when they said he is not here he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they didn t find you 
now you say go tell your lord behold elijah is here 
it will happen as soon as i am gone from you that the spirit of yahweh will carry you i don t know where and so when i come and tell ahab and he can t find you he will kill me but i your servant have feared yahweh from my youth 
wasn t it told my lord what i did when jezebel killed the prophets of yahweh how i hid one hundred men of yahweh s prophets with fifty to a cave and fed them with bread and water ?
now you say go tell your lord behold elijah is here and he will kill me 
elijah said as yahweh of armies lives before whom i stand i will surely show myself to him today 
so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah 
it happened when ahab saw elijah that ahab said to him is that you you troubler of israel ? 
he answered i have not troubled israel but you and your father s house in that you have forsaken the commandments of yahweh and you have followed the baals 
now therefore send and gather to me all israel to mount carmel and four hundred fifty of the prophets of baal and four hundred of the prophets of the asherah who eat at jezebel s table 
so ahab sent to all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together to mount carmel 
elijah came near to all the people and said how long will you waver between the two sides ? if yahweh is god follow him but if baal then follow him the people answered him not a word 
then elijah said to the people i even i only am left a prophet of yahweh but baal s prophets are four hundred fifty men 
let them therefore give us two bulls and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire under it 
you call on the name of your god and i will call on the name of yahweh the god who answers by fire let him be god all the people answered it is well said 
elijah said to the prophets of baal choose one bull for yourselves and dress it first for you are many and call on the name of your god but put no fire under it 
they took the bull which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying baal hear us but there was no voice nor any who answered they leaped about the altar which was made 
it happened at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is musing or he has gone aside or he is on a journey or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened 
they cried aloud and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances until the blood gushed out on them 
it was so when midday was past that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering but there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any who regarded 
elijah said to all the people come near to me and all the people came near to him he repaired the altar of yahweh that was thrown down 
elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob to whom the word of yahweh came saying israel shall be your name 
with the stones he built an altar in the name of yahweh he made a trench around the altar large enough to contain two measures of seed 
he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood he said fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood 
he said do it a second time and they did it the second time he said do it a third time and they did it the third time 
the water ran around the altar and he also filled the trench with water 
it happened at the time of the offering of the offering that elijah the prophet came near and said yahweh the god of abraham of isaac and of israel let it be known this day that you are god in israel and that i am your servant and that i have done all these things at your word 
hear me yahweh hear me that this people may know that you yahweh are god and that you have turned their heart back again 
then the fire of yahweh fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench 
when all the people saw it they fell on their faces they said yahweh he is god ! yahweh he is god ! 
elijah said to them seize the prophets of baal ! don t let one of them escape ! they seized them elijah brought them down to the brook kishon and killed them there 
elijah said to ahab get up eat and drink for there is the sound of abundance of rain 
so ahab went up to eat and to drink elijah went up to the top of carmel and he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees 
he said to his servant go up now look toward the sea he went up and looked and said there is nothing he said go again seven times 
it happened at the seventh time that he said behold a small cloud like a man s hand is rising out of the sea he said go up tell ahab get ready and go down so that the rain doesn t stop you 
it happened in a little while that the sky grew black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain ahab rode and went to jezreel 
the hand of yahweh was on elijah and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel 
ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword 
then jezebel sent a messenger to elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i don t make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time ! 
when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongs to judah and left his servant there 
but he himself went a day s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o yahweh take away my life for i am not better than my fathers 
he lay down and slept under a juniper tree and behold an angel touched him and said to him arise and eat ! 
he looked and behold there was at his head a cake baked on the coals and a jar of water he ate and drank and lay down again 
the angel of yahweh came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for you 
he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to horeb the mount of god 
he came there to a cave and lodged there and behold the word of yahweh came to him and he said to him what are you doing here elijah ? 
he said i have been very jealous for yahweh the god of armies for the children of israel have forsaken your covenant thrown down your altars and slain your prophets with the sword i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away 
he said go out and stand on the mountain before yahweh behold yahweh passed by and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before yahweh but yahweh was not in the wind after the wind an earthquake but yahweh was not in the earthquake 
after the earthquake a fire passed but yahweh was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice 
it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave behold a voice came to him and said what are you doing here elijah ? 
he said i have been very jealous for yahweh the god of armies for the children of israel have forsaken your covenant thrown down your altars and slain your prophets with the sword i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away 
yahweh said to him go return on your way to the wilderness of damascus when you arrive you shall anoint hazael to be king over syria 
you shall anoint jehu the son of nimshi to be king over israel and you shall anoint elisha the son of shaphat of abel meholah to be prophet in your place 
it shall happen that he who escapes from the sword of hazael jehu will kill and he who escapes from the sword of jehu elisha will kill 
yet will i leave seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed to baal and every mouth which has not kissed him 
so he departed there and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and elijah passed over to him and cast his mantle on him 
he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me please kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow you he said to him go back again for what have i done to you ? 
he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and killed them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave to the people and they ate then he arose and went after elijah and served him 
ben hadad the king of syria gathered all his army together and there were thirty two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and fought against it 
he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and said to him thus says ben hadad 
 your silver and your gold is mine your wives also and your children even the best are mine 
the king of israel answered it is according to your saying my lord o king i am yours and all that i have 
the messengers came again and said ben hadad says i sent indeed to you saying you shall deliver me your silver and your gold and your wives and your children 
but i will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants and it shall be that whatever is pleasant in your eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it away 
then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said please notice how this man seeks mischief for he sent to me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold and i didn t deny him 
all the elders and all the people said to him don t listen neither consent 
therefore he said to the messengers of ben hadad tell my lord the king all that you sent for to your servant at the first i will do but this thing i cannot do the messengers departed and brought him back the message 
ben hadad sent to him and said the gods do so to me and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me 
the king of israel answered tell him don t let him who puts on his armor brag like he who takes it off 
it happened when ben hadad heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said to his servants prepare to attack ! they prepared to attack the city 
behold a prophet came near to ahab king of israel and said thus says yahweh have you seen all this great multitude ? behold i will deliver it into your hand this day and you shall know that i am yahweh 
ahab said by whom ? he said thus says yahweh by the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said who shall begin the battle ? he answered you 
then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces and they were two hundred and thirty two after them he mustered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand 
they went out at noon but ben hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty two kings who helped him 
the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first and ben hadad sent out and they told him saying men are coming out from samaria 
he said if they have come out for peace take them alive or if they have come out for war take them alive 
so these went out of the city the young men of the princes of the provinces and the army which followed them 
they each killed his man the syrians fled and israel pursued them ben hadad the king of syria escaped on a horse with horsemen 
the king of israel went out and struck the horses and chariots and killed the syrians with a great slaughter 
the prophet came near to the king of israel and said to him go strengthen yourself and mark and see what you do for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against you 
the servants of the king of syria said to him their god is a god of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they 
do this thing take the kings away every man out of his place and put captains in their place 
muster an army like the army that you have lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot we will fight against them in the plain and surely we will be stronger than them he listened to their voice and did so 
it happened at the return of the year that ben hadad mustered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel 
the children of israel were mustered and were provisioned and went against them the children of israel encamped before them like two little flocks of young goats but the syrians filled the country 
a man of god came near and spoke to the king of israel and said thus says yahweh because the syrians have said yahweh is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys therefore i will deliver all this great multitude into your hand and you shall know that i am yahweh 
they encamped one over against the other seven days so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the syrians in one day 
but the rest fled to aphek into the city and the wall fell on twenty seven thousand men who were left ben hadad fled and came into the city into an inner room 
his servants said to him see now we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings please let us put sackcloth on our bodies and ropes on our heads and go out to the king of israel maybe he will save your life 
so they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes on their heads and came to the king of israel and said your servant ben hadad says please let me live he said is he still alive ? he is my brother 
now the men observed diligently and hurried to take this phrase and they said your brother ben hadad then he said go bring him then ben hadad came out to him and he caused him to come up into the chariot 
ben hadad said to him the cities which my father took from your father i will restore you shall make streets for yourself in damascus as my father made in samaria i said ahab will let you go with this covenant so he made a covenant with him and let him go 
a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of yahweh please strike me ! the man refused to strike him 
then he said to him because you have not obeyed the voice of yahweh behold as soon as you are departed from me a lion shall kill you as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and killed him 
then he found another man and said please strike me the man struck him smiting and wounding him 
so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes 
as the king passed by he cried to the king and he said your servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man to me and said guard this man ! if by any means he be missing then your life shall be for his life or else you shall pay a talent of silver 
as your servant was busy here and there he was gone the king of israel said to him so your judgment shall be you yourself have decided it 
he hurried and took the headband away from his eyes and the king of israel recognized that he was of the prophets 
he said to him thus says yahweh because you have let go out of your hand the man whom i had devoted to destruction therefore your life shall go for his life and your people for his people 
the king of israel went to his house sullen and angry and came to samaria 
it happened after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria 
ahab spoke to naboth saying give me your vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near to my house and i will give you for it a better vineyard than it or if it seems good to you i will give you its worth in money 
naboth said to ahab may yahweh forbid me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers to you ! 
ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i will not give you the inheritance of my fathers he laid himself down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread 
but jezebel his wife came to him and said to him why is your spirit so sad that you eat no bread ? 
he said to her because i spoke to naboth the jezreelite and said to him give me your vineyard for money or else if it pleases you i will give you another vineyard for it he answered i will not give you my vineyard 
jezebel his wife said to him do you now govern the kingdom of israel ? arise and eat bread and let your heart be merry i will give you the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite 
so she wrote letters in ahab s name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city who lived with naboth 
she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people 
set two men base fellows before him and let them testify against him saying you cursed god and the king ! then carry him out and stone him to death 
the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city did as jezebel had sent to them according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them 
they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people 
the two men the base fellows came in and sat before him the base fellows testified against him even against naboth in the presence of the people saying naboth cursed god and the king ! then they carried him out of the city and stoned him to death with stones 
then they sent to jezebel saying naboth has been stoned and is dead 
it happened when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give you for money for naboth is not alive but dead 
it happened when ahab heard that naboth was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take possession of it 
the word of yahweh came to elijah the tishbite saying 
 arise go down to meet ahab king of israel who dwells in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it 
you shall speak to him saying thus says yahweh have you killed and also taken possession ? you shall speak to him saying thus says yahweh in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth dogs will lick your blood even yours 
ahab said to elijah have you found me my enemy ? he answered i have found you because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of yahweh 
behold i will bring evil on you and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from ahab everyone who urinates against a wall and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in israel 
i will make your house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger and have made israel to sin 
yahweh also spoke of jezebel saying the dogs shall eat jezebel by the rampart of jezreel 
the dogs will eat he who dies of ahab in the city and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field 
but there was none like ahab who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of yahweh whom jezebel his wife stirred up 
he did very abominably in following idols according to all that the amorites did whom yahweh cast out before the children of israel 
it happened when ahab heard those words that he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly 
the word of yahweh came to elijah the tishbite saying 
 see how ahab humbles himself before me ? because he humbles himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but in his son s days will i bring the evil on his house 
they continued three years without war between syria and israel 
it happened in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel 
the king of israel said to his servants you know that ramoth gilead is ours and we are still and don t take it out of the hand of the king of syria ? 
he said to jehoshaphat will you go with me to battle to ramoth gilead ? jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses 
jehoshaphat said to the king of israel please inquire first for the word of yahweh 
then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said to them shall i go against ramoth gilead to battle or shall i forbear ? they said go up for the lord will deliver it into the hand of the king 
but jehoshaphat said isn t there here a prophet of yahweh that we may inquire of him ? 
the king of israel said to jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of yahweh micaiah the son of imlah but i hate him for he does not prophesy good concerning me but evil jehoshaphat said don t let the king say so 
then the king of israel called an officer and said quickly get micaiah the son of imlah 
now the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah were sitting each on his throne arrayed in their robes in an open place at the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets were prophesying before them 
zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and said thus says yahweh with these you shall push the syrians until they are consumed 
all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramoth gilead and prosper for yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king 
the messenger who went to call micaiah spoke to him saying see now the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth please let your word be like the word of one of them and speak good 
micaiah said as yahweh lives what yahweh says to me that i will speak 
when he had come to the king the king said to him micaiah shall we go to ramoth gilead to battle or shall we forbear ? he answered him go up and prosper and yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king 
the king said to him how many times do i have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of yahweh ? 
he said i saw all israel scattered on the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd yahweh said these have no master let them each return to his house in peace 
the king of israel said to jehoshaphat didn t i tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me but evil ? 
micaiah said therefore hear the word of yahweh i saw yahweh sitting on his throne and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left 
yahweh said who shall entice ahab that he may go up and fall at ramoth gilead ? one said one thing and another said another 
a spirit came out and stood before yahweh and said i will entice him 
yahweh said to him how ? he said i will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets he said you will entice him and will also prevail go out and do so 
now therefore behold yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets and yahweh has spoken evil concerning you 
then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and struck micaiah on the cheek and said which way did the spirit of yahweh go from me to speak to you ? 
micaiah said behold you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to hide yourself 
the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back to amon the governor of the city and to joash the king s son 
say thus says the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i come in peace 
micaiah said if you return at all in peace yahweh has not spoken by me he said listen all you people ! 
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramoth gilead 
the king of israel said to jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and go into the battle but you put on your robes the king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle 
now the king of syria had commanded the thirty two captains of his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great except only with the king of israel 
it happened when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said surely that is the king of israel ! and they turned aside to fight against him jehoshaphat cried out 
it happened when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him 
a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of israel between the joints of the armor therefore he said to the driver of his chariot turn your hand and carry me out of the battle for i am severely wounded 
the battle increased that day the king was propped up in his chariot facing the syrians and died at evening the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot 
a cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to his country ! 
so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried the king in samaria 
they washed the chariot by the pool of samaria and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves according to the word of yahweh which he spoke 
now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he built and all the cities that he built aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned in his place 
jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel 
jehoshaphat was thirty five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty five years in jerusalem his mother s name was azubah the daughter of shilhi 
he walked in all the way of asa his father he didn t turn aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of yahweh however the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places 
jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel 
now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that he showed and how he warred aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
the remnant of the sodomites that remained in the days of his father asa he put away out of the land 
there was no king in edom a deputy was king 
jehoshaphat made ships of tarshish to go to ophir for gold but they didn t go for the ships were broken at ezion geber 
then ahaziah the son of ahab said to jehoshaphat let my servants go with your servants in the ships but jehoshaphat would not 
jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father jehoram his son reigned in his place 
ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria in the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and he reigned two years over israel 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat in which he made israel to sin 
he served baal and worshiped him and provoked to anger yahweh the god of israel according to all that his father had done 
moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab 
ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in samaria and was sick so he sent messengers and said to them go inquire of baal zebub the god of ekron whether i will recover of this sickness 
but the angel of yahweh said to elijah the tishbite arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and tell them is it because there is no god in israel that you go to inquire of baal zebub the god of ekron ?
now therefore thus says yahweh you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up but shall surely die elijah departed 
the messengers returned to him and he said to them why is it that you have returned ? 
they said to him a man came up to meet us and said to us go return to the king who sent you and tell him thus says yahweh is it because there is no god in israel that you send to inquire of baal zebub the god of ekron ? therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up but shall surely die 
he said to them what kind of man was he who came up to meet you and told you these words ? 
they answered him he was a hairy man and wearing a leather belt around his waist he said it is elijah the tishbite 
then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him he went up to him and behold he was sitting on the top of the hill he said to him man of god the king has said come down ! 
elijah answered to the captain of fifty if i am a man of god let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty ! fire came down from the sky and consumed him and his fifty 
again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty he answered him man of god the king has said come down quickly ! 
elijah answered them if i am a man of god let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty ! the fire of god came down from the sky and consumed him and his fifty 
again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before elijah and begged him and said to him man of god please let my life and the life of these fifty your servants be precious in your sight 
behold fire came down from the sky and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties but now let my life be precious in your sight 
the angel of yahweh said to elijah go down with him don t be afraid of him he arose and went down with him to the king 
he said to him thus says yahweh because you have sent messengers to inquire of baal zebub the god of ekron is it because there is no god in israel to inquire of his word ? therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up but shall surely die 
so he died according to the word of yahweh which elijah had spoken jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son 
now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
it happened when yahweh would take up elijah by a whirlwind into heaven that elijah went with elisha from gilgal 
elijah said to elisha please wait here for yahweh has sent me as far as bethel elisha said as yahweh lives and as your soul lives i will not leave you so they went down to bethel 
the sons of the prophets who were at bethel came out to elisha and said to him do you know that yahweh will take away your master from your head today ? he said yes i know it hold your peace 
elijah said to him elisha please wait here for yahweh has sent me to jericho he said as yahweh lives and as your soul lives i will not leave you so they came to jericho 
the sons of the prophets who were at jericho came near to elisha and said to him do you know that yahweh will take away your master from your head today ? he answered yes i know it hold your peace 
elijah said to him please wait here for yahweh has sent me to the jordan he said as yahweh lives and as your soul lives i will not leave you they both went on 
fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance and they both stood by the jordan 
elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and struck the waters and they were divided here and there so that they two went over on dry ground 
it happened when they had gone over that elijah said to elisha ask what i shall do for you before i am taken from you elisha said please let a double portion of your spirit be on me 
he said you have asked a hard thing if you see me when i am taken from you it shall be so for you but if not it shall not be so 
it happened as they still went on and talked that behold a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven 
elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariots of israel and its horsemen ! he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces 
he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the jordan 
he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and struck the waters and said where is yahweh the god of elijah ? when he also had struck the waters they were divided here and there and elisha went over 
when the sons of the prophets who were at jericho over against him saw him they said the spirit of elijah rests on elisha they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him 
they said to him see now there are with your servants fifty strong men please let them go and seek your master perhaps the spirit of yahweh has taken him up and put him on some mountain or into some valley he said you shall not send them 
when they urged him until he was ashamed he said send them they sent therefore fifty men and they searched for three days but didn t find him 
they came back to him while he stayed at jericho and he said to them didn t i tell you don t go ? 
the men of the city said to elisha behold please the situation of this city is pleasant as my lord sees but the water is bad and the land miscarries 
he said bring me a new jar and put salt in it they brought it to him 
he went out to the spring of the waters and threw salt into it and said thus says yahweh i have healed these waters there shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying 
so the waters were healed to this day according to the word of elisha which he spoke 
he went up from there to bethel as he was going up by the way some youths came out of the city and mocked him and said to him go up you baldy ! go up you baldhead ! 
he looked behind him and saw them and cursed them in the name of yahweh two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty two of those youths 
he went from there to mount carmel and from there he returned to samaria 
now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria in the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twelve years 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the pillar of baal that his father had made 
nevertheless he held to the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat with which he made israel to sin he didn t depart from it 
now mesha king of moab was a sheep breeder and he rendered to the king of israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs and of one hundred thousand rams 
but it happened when ahab was dead that the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel 
king jehoram went out of samaria at that time and mustered all israel 
he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab has rebelled against me will you go with me against moab to battle ? he said i will go up i am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses 
he said which way shall we go up ? he answered the way of the wilderness of edom 
so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of edom and they made a circuit of seven days journey there was no water for the army nor for the animals that followed them 
the king of israel said alas ! for yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab 
but jehoshaphat said isn t there here a prophet of yahweh that we may inquire of yahweh by him ? one of the king of israel s servants answered elisha the son of shaphat is here who poured water on the hands of elijah 
jehoshaphat said the word of yahweh is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him 
elisha said to the king of israel what have i to do with you ? go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother the king of israel said to him no for yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab 
elisha said as yahweh of armies lives before whom i stand surely were it not that i respect the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward you nor see you 
but now bring me a minstrel it happened when the minstrel played that the hand of yahweh came on him 
he said thus says yahweh make this valley full of trenches 
for thus says yahweh you will not see wind neither will you see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water and you will drink both you and your livestock and your animals 
this is but a light thing in the sight of yahweh he will also deliver the moabites into your hand 
you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all springs of water and mar every good piece of land with stones 
it happened in the morning about the time of offering the offering that behold water came by the way of edom and the country was filled with water 
now when all the moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them they gathered themselves together all who were able to put on armor and upward and stood on the border 
they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone on the water and the moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood 
they said this is blood the kings are surely destroyed and they have struck each other now therefore moab to the spoil ! 
when they came to the camp of israel the israelites rose up and struck the moabites so that they fled before them and they went forward into the land smiting the moabites 
they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the springs of water and felled all the good trees until in kir hareseth only they left its stones however the men armed with slings went about it and struck it 
when the king of moab saw that the battle was too severe for him he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword to break through to the king of edom but they could not 
then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall there was great wrath against israel and they departed from him and returned to their own land 
now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to elisha saying your servant my husband is dead you know that your servant feared yahweh now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves 
elisha said to her what shall i do for you ? tell me what do you have in the house ? she said your handmaid has nothing in the house except a pot of oil 
then he said go borrow containers from of all your neighbors even empty containers don t borrow just a few 
you shall go in and shut the door on you and on your sons and pour out into all those containers and you shall set aside that which is full 
so she went from him and shut the door on her and on her sons they brought the containers to her and she poured out 
it happened when the containers were full that she said to her son bring me another container he said to her there isn t another container the oil stopped flowing 
then she came and told the man of god he said go sell the oil and pay your debt and you and your sons live on the rest 
it fell on a day that elisha passed to shunem where there was a prominent woman and she persuaded him to eat bread so it was that as often as he passed by he turned in there to eat bread 
she said to her husband see now i perceive that this is a holy man of god that passes by us continually 
please let us make a little room on the wall let us set for him there a bed a table a chair and a lamp stand it shall be when he comes to us that he shall turn in there 
one day he came there and he turned into the room and lay there 
he said to gehazi his servant call this shunammite when he had called her she stood before him 
he said to him say now to her behold you have cared for us with all this care what is to be done for you ? would you like to be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the army ? she answered i dwell among my own people 
he said what then is to be done for her ? gehazi answered most certainly she has no son and her husband is old 
he said call her when he had called her she stood in the door 
he said at this season when the time comes around you will embrace a son she said no my lord you man of god do not lie to your handmaid 
the woman conceived and bore a son at that season when the time came around as elisha had said to her 
when the child was grown it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers 
he said to his father my head ! my head ! he said to his servant carry him to his mother 
when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees until noon and then died 
she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god and shut the door on him and went out 
she called to her husband and said please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys that i may run to the man of god and come again 
he said why would you want go to him today ? it is neither new moon nor sabbath she said it s alright 
then she saddled a donkey and said to her servant drive and go forward ! don t slow down for me unless i ask you to 
so she went and came to the man of god to mount carmel it happened when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to gehazi his servant behold there is the shunammite 
please run now to meet her and ask her is it well with you ? is it well with your husband ? is it well with the child ? she answered it is well 
when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught hold of his feet gehazi came near to thrust her away but the man of god said leave her alone for her soul is troubled within her and yahweh has hidden it from me and has not told me 
then she said did i desire a son of my lord ? didn t i say do not deceive me ? 
then he said to gehazi tuck your cloak into your belt take my staff in your hand and go your way if you meet any man don t greet him and if anyone greets you don t answer him again then lay my staff on the face of the child 
the mother of the child said as yahweh lives and as your soul lives i will not leave you he arose and followed her 
gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff on the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing therefore he returned to meet him and told him saying the child has not awakened 
when elisha had come into the house behold the child was dead and laid on his bed 
he went in therefore and shut the door on them both and prayed to yahweh 
he went up and lay on the child and put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands he stretched himself on him and the flesh of the child grew warm 
then he returned and walked in the house once back and forth and went up and stretched himself on him then the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes 
he called gehazi and said call this shunammite ! so he called her when she had come in to him he said take up your son 
then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and she took up her son and went out 
elisha came again to gilgal there was a famine in the land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said to his servant set on the great pot and boil stew for the sons of the prophets 
one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full and came and shred them into the pot of stew for they didn t recognize them 
so they poured out for the men to eat it happened as they were eating of the stew that they cried out and said man of god there is death in the pot ! they could not eat of it 
but he said then bring meal he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat there was no harm in the pot 
a man from baal shalishah came and brought the man of god bread of the first fruits twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack he said give to the people that they may eat 
his servant said what should i set this before a hundred men ? but he said give the people that they may eat for thus says yahweh they will eat and will have some left over 
so he set it before them and they ate and left some of it according to the word of yahweh 
now naaman captain of the army of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him yahweh had given victory to syria he was also a mighty man of valor but he was a leper 
the syrians had gone out in bands and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maiden and she waited on naaman s wife 
she said to her mistress i wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in samaria ! then he would heal him of his leprosy 
someone went in and told his lord saying the maiden who is from the land of israel said this 
the king of syria said go now and i will send a letter to the king of israel he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of clothing 
he brought the letter to the king of israel saying now when this letter has come to you behold i have sent naaman my servant to you that you may heal him of his leprosy 
it happened when the king of israel had read the letter that he tore his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make alive that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy ? but please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me 
it was so when elisha the man of god heard that the king of israel had torn his clothes that he sent to the king saying why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel 
so naaman came with his horses and with his chariots and stood at the door of the house of elisha 
elisha sent a messenger to him saying go and wash in the jordan seven times and your flesh shall come again to you and you shall be clean 
but naaman was angry and went away and said behold i thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of yahweh his god and wave his hand over the place and heal the leper 
aren t abanah and pharpar the rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel ? couldn t i wash in them and be clean ? so he turned and went away in a rage 
his servants came near and spoke to him and said my father if the prophet had asked you do some great thing wouldn t you have done it ? how much rather then when he says to you wash and be clean ? 
then went he down and dipped himself seven times in the jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child and he was clean 
he returned to the man of god he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said see now i know that there is no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore please take a gift from your servant 
but he said as yahweh lives before whom i stand i will receive none he urged him to take it but he refused 
naaman said if not then please let two mules burden of earth be given to your servant for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods but to yahweh 
in this thing may yahweh pardon your servant when my master goes into the house of rimmon to worship there and he leans on my hand and i bow myself in the house of rimmon when i bow myself in the house of rimmon may yahweh pardon your servant in this thing 
he said to him go in peace so he departed from him a little way 
but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said behold my master has spared this naaman the syrian in not receiving at his hands that which he brought as yahweh lives i will run after him and take something from him 
so gehazi followed after naaman when naaman saw one running after him he came down from the chariot to meet him and said is all well ? 
he said all is well my master has sent me saying behold even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of ephraim please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing 
naaman said be pleased to take two talents he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothing and laid them on two of his servants and they carried them before him 
when he came to the hill he took them from their hand and stored them in the house then he let the men go and they departed 
but he went in and stood before his master elisha said to him where did you come from gehazi ? he said your servant went nowhere 
he said to him didn t my heart go with you when the man turned from his chariot to meet you ? is it a time to receive money and to receive garments and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and cattle and male servants and female servants ?
therefore the leprosy of naaman will cling to you and to your seed forever he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow 
the sons of the prophets said to elisha see now the place where we dwell before you is too small for us 
please let us go to the jordan and every man take a beam from there and let us make us a place there where we may dwell he answered go ! 
one said please be pleased to go with your servants he answered i will go 
so he went with them when they came to the jordan they cut down wood 
but as one was felling a beam the axe head fell into the water then he cried and said alas my master ! for it was borrowed 
the man of god asked where did it fall ? he showed him the place he cut down a stick threw it in there and made the iron float 
he said take it so he put out his hand and took it 
now the king of syria was warring against israel and he took counsel with his servants saying my camp will be in such and such a place 
the man of god sent to the king of israel saying beware that you not pass such a place for the syrians are coming down there 
the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of and he saved himself there not once nor twice 
the heart of the king of syria was very troubled about this he called his servants and said to them won t you show me which of us is for the king of israel ? 
one of his servants said no my lord o king but elisha the prophet who is in israel tells the king of israel the words that you speak in your bedroom 
he said go and see where he is that i may send and get him it was told him saying behold he is in dothan 
therefore he sent horses chariots and a great army there they came by night and surrounded the city 
when the servant of the man of god had risen early and gone out behold an army with horses and chariots was around the city his servant said to him alas my master ! what shall we do ? 
he answered don t be afraid for those who are with us are more than those who are with them 
elisha prayed and said yahweh please open his eyes that he may see yahweh opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around elisha 
when they came down to him elisha prayed to yahweh and said please strike this people with blindness he struck them with blindness according to the word of elisha 
elisha said to them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom you seek he led them to samaria 
it happened when they had come into samaria that elisha said yahweh open the eyes of these men that they may see yahweh opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of samaria 
the king of israel said to elisha when he saw them my father shall i strike them ? shall i strike them ? 
he answered you shall not strike them would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow ? set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master 
he prepared great feast for them when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master the bands of syria stopped raiding the land of israel 
it happened after this that benhadad king of syria gathered all his army and went up and besieged samaria 
there was a great famine in samaria behold they besieged it until a donkey s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver and the fourth part of a kab of dove s dung for five pieces of silver 
as the king of israel was passing by on the wall a woman cried to him saying help my lord o king ! 
he said if yahweh doesn t help you from where could i help you ? from of the threshing floor or from the winepress ? 
the king said to her what ails you ? she answered this woman said to me give your son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow 
so we boiled my son and ate him and i said to her on the next day give your son that we may eat him and she has hidden her son 
it happened when the king heard the words of the woman that he tore his clothes now he was passing by on the wall and the people looked and behold he had sackcloth underneath on his flesh 
then he said god do so to me and more also if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stay on him this day 
but elisha was sitting in his house and the elders were sitting with him then the king sent a man from before him but before the messenger came to him he said to the elders do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head ? behold when the messenger comes shut the door and hold the door shut against him isn t the sound of his master s feet behind him ? 
while he was still talking with them behold the messenger came down to him then he said behold this evil is from yahweh why should i wait for yahweh any longer ? 
elisha said hear the word of yahweh thus says yahweh tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria 
then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said behold if yahweh made windows in heaven could this thing be ? he said behold you shall see it with your eyes but shall not eat of it 
now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate they said one to another why do we sit here until we die ?
if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there if we sit still here we also die now therefore come and let us surrender to the army of the syrians if they save us alive we will live and if they kill us we will only die 
they rose up in the twilight to go to the camp of the syrians when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the syrians behold there was no man there 
for the lord had made the army of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great army and they said one to another behold the king of israel has hired against us the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come on us 
therefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their donkeys even the camp as it was and fled for their life 
when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp they went into one tent and ate and drink and carried there silver and gold and clothing and went and hid it then they came back and entered into another tent and carried there also and went and hid it 
then they said one to another we aren t doing right this day is a day of good news and we keep silent if we wait until the morning light punishment will overtake us now therefore come let us go and tell the king s household 
so they came and called to the porter of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of man but the horses tied and the donkeys tied and the tents as they were 
he called the porters and they told it to the king s household within 
the king arose in the night and said to his servants i will now show you what the syrians have done to us they know that we are hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall take them alive and get into the city 
one of his servants answered please let some take five of the horses that remain which are left in the city behold they are like all the multitude of israel who are left in it behold they are like all the multitude of israel who are consumed let us send and see 
they took therefore two chariots with horses and the king sent after the army of the syrians saying go and see 
they went after them to the jordan and behold all the way was full of garments and vessels which the syrians had cast away in their haste the messengers returned and told the king 
the people went out and plundered the camp of the syrians so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel according to the word of yahweh 
the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate and the people trod on him in the gate and he died as the man of god had said who spoke when the king came down to him 
it happened as the man of god had spoken to the king saying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of samaria 
and that captain answered the man of god and said now behold if yahweh should make windows in heaven might such a thing be ? and he said behold you shall see it with your eyes but shall not eat of it 
it happened like that to him for the people trod on him in the gate and he died 
now elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go you and your household and stay for a while wherever you can for yahweh has called for a famine it shall also come on the land seven years 
the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of god she went with her household and lived in the land of the philistines seven years 
it happened at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the philistines then she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land 
now the king was talking with gehazi the servant of the man of god saying please tell me all the great things that elisha has done 
it happened as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom elisha restored to life 
when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed to her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now 
elisha came to damascus and benhadad the king of syria was sick it was told him saying the man of god has come here 
the king said to hazael take a present in your hand and go meet the man of god and inquire of yahweh by him saying will i recover from this sickness ? 
so hazael went to meet him and took a present with him even of every good thing of damascus forty camels burden and came and stood before him and said your son benhadad king of syria has sent me to you saying will i recover from this sickness ? 
elisha said to him go tell him you shall surely recover however yahweh has shown me that he shall surely die 
he settled his gaze steadfastly on him until he was ashamed then the man of god wept 
hazael said why do you weep my lord ? he answered because i know the evil that you will do to the children of israel you will set their strongholds on fire and you will kill their young men with the sword and will dash in pieces their little ones and rip up their women with child 
hazael said but what is your servant who is but a dog that he should do this great thing ? elisha answered yahweh has shown me that you will be king over syria 
then he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to him what did elisha say to you ? he answered he told me that you would surely recover 
it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died then hazael reigned in his place 
in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat being king of judah then jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah began to reign 
he was thirty two years old when he began to reign he reigned eight years in jerusalem 
he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab as wife he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh 
however yahweh would not destroy judah for david his servant s sake as he promised him to give to him a lamp for his children always 
in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made a king over themselves 
then joram passed over to zair and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and struck the edomites who surrounded him and the captains of the chariots and the people fled to their tents 
so edom revolted from under the hand of judah to this day then libnah revolted at the same time 
the rest of the acts of joram and all that he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and ahaziah his son reigned in his place 
in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah began to reign 
twenty two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem his mother s name was athaliah the daughter of omri king of israel 
he walked in the way of the house of ahab and did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh as did the house of ahab for he was the son in law of the house of ahab 
elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him put your belt on your waist take this vial of oil in your hand and go to ramoth gilead 
when you come there find jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him arise up from among his brothers and carry him to an inner room 
then take the vial of oil and pour it on his head and say thus says yahweh i have anointed you king over israel then open the door flee and don t wait 
so the young man even the young man the prophet went to ramoth gilead 
when he came behold the captains of the army were sitting then he said i have a message for you captain jehu said to which of us all ? he said to you o captain 
he arose and went into the house then he poured the oil on his head and said to him thus says yahweh the god of israel i have anointed you king over the people of yahweh even over israel 
you shall strike the house of ahab your master that i may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of yahweh at the hand of jezebel 
for the whole house of ahab shall perish i will cut off from ahab everyone who urinates against a wall both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in israel 
the dogs will eat jezebel on the plot of ground of jezreel and there shall be none to bury her he opened the door and fled 
then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said to him is all well ? why did this mad fellow come to you ? he said to them you know the man and what his talk was 
they said that is a lie tell us now he said he said to me thus says yahweh i have anointed you king over israel 
then they hurried and took every man his garment and put it under him on the top of the stairs and blew the trumpet saying jehu is king 
so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against joram now joram was keeping ramoth gilead he and all israel because of hazael king of syria 
but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him when he fought with hazael king of syria jehu said if this is your thinking then let no one escape and go out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel 
so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram lay there ahaziah king of judah had come down to see joram 
now the watchman was standing on the tower in jezreel and he spied the company of jehu as he came and said i see a company joram said take a horseman and send to meet them and let him say is it peace ? 
so there went one on horseback to meet him and said thus says the king is it peace ? jehu said what do you have to do with peace ? fall in behind me ! the watchman said the messenger came to them but he isn t coming back 
then he sent out a second on horseback who came to them and said thus says the king is it peace ? jehu answered what do you have to do with peace ? fall in behind me ! 
the watchman said he came to them and isn t coming back the driving is like the driving of jehu the son of nimshi for he drives furiously 
joram said get ready ! they got his chariot ready joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in his chariot and they went out to meet jehu and found him in the portion of naboth the jezreelite 
it happened when joram saw jehu that he said is it peace jehu ? he answered what peace so long as the prostitution of your mother jezebel and her witchcraft abound ? 
joram turned his hands and fled and said to ahaziah there is treason ahaziah ! 
jehu drew his bow with his full strength and struck joram between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk down in his chariot 
then jehu said to bidkar his captain pick him up and throw him in the plot of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember how when you and i rode together after ahab his father yahweh laid this burden on him 
 surely i have seen yesterday the blood of naboth and the blood of his sons says yahweh and i will repay you in this plot of ground says yahweh now therefore take and cast him onto the plot of ground according to the word of yahweh 
but when ahaziah the king of judah saw this he fled by the way of the garden house jehu followed after him and said strike him also in the chariot ! they struck him at the ascent of gur which is by ibleam he fled to megiddo and died there 
his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of david 
in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah to reign over judah 
when jehu had come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and she painted her eyes and attired her head and looked out at the window 
as jehu entered in at the gate she said do you come in peace zimri you murderer of your master ? 
he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side ? who ? two or three eunuchs looked out at him 
he said throw her down ! so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses then he trampled her under foot 
when he had come in he ate and drink and he said see now to this cursed woman and bury her for she is a king s daughter 
they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands 
therefore they came back and told him he said this is the word of yahweh which he spoke by his servant elijah the tishbite saying the dogs will eat the flesh of jezebel on the plot of jezreel 
and the body of jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this is jezebel 
now ahab had seventy sons in samaria jehu wrote letters and sent to samaria to the rulers of jezreel even the elders and to those who brought up the sons of ahab saying 
but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold the two kings didn t stand before him ! how then shall we stand ? 
he who was over the household and he who was over the city the elders also and those who raised the children sent to jehu saying we are your servants and will do all that you ask us we will not make any man king you do that which is good in your eyes 
then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying if you are on my side and if you will listen to my voice take the heads of the men your master s sons and come to me to jezreel by tomorrow this time now the king s sons being seventy persons were with the great men of the city who brought them up 
it happened when the letter came to them that they took the king s sons and killed them even seventy persons and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him to jezreel 
a messenger came and told him they have brought the heads of the king s sons he said lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning 
it happened in the morning that he went out and stood and said to all the people you are righteous behold i conspired against my master and killed him but who struck all these ?
know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of yahweh which yahweh spoke concerning the house of ahab for yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant elijah 
so jehu struck all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel with all his great men his familiar friends and his priests until he left him none remaining 
he arose and departed and went to samaria as he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way 
jehu met with the brothers of ahaziah king of judah and said who are you ? they answered we are the brothers of ahaziah we are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen 
he said take them alive ! they took them alive and killed them at the pit of the shearing house even forty two men he didn t leave any of them 
when he had departed from there he met jehonadab the son of rechab coming to meet him he greeted him and said to him is your heart right as my heart is with your heart ? jehonadab answered it is if it is give me your hand he gave him his hand and he took him up to him into the chariot 
he said come with me and see my zeal for yahweh so they made him ride in his chariot 
when he came to samaria he struck all who remained to ahab in samaria until he had destroyed him according to the word of yahweh which he spoke to elijah 
jehu gathered all the people together and said to them ahab served baal a little but jehu will serve him much 
now therefore call to me all the prophets of baal all of his worshippers and all of his priests let none be absent for i have a great sacrifice to baal whoever is absent he shall not live but jehu did it in subtlety intending that he might destroy the worshippers of baal 
jehu said sanctify a solemn assembly for baal ! they proclaimed it 
jehu sent through all israel and all the worshippers of baal came so that there was not a man left that didn t come they came into the house of baal and the house of baal was filled from one end to another 
he said to him who was over the vestry bring out robes for all the worshippers of baal ! he brought robes out to them 
jehu went with jehonadab the son of rechab into the house of baal then he said to the worshippers of baal search and look that there are here with you none of the servants of yahweh but the worshippers of baal only 
they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings now jehu had appointed him eighty men outside and said if any of the men whom i bring into your hands escape he who lets him go his life shall be for the life of him 
it happened as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering that jehu said to the guard and to the captains go in and kill them ! let none escape they struck them with the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out and went to the city of the house of baal 
they brought out the pillars that were in the house of baal and burned them 
they broke down the pillar of baal and broke down the house of baal and made it a latrine to this day 
thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel 
however from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat with which he made israel to sin jehu didn t depart from after them the golden calves that were in bethel and that were in dan 
yahweh said to jehu because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes and have done to the house of ahab according to all that was in my heart your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel 
but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of yahweh the god of israel with all his heart he didn t depart from the sins of jeroboam with which he made israel to sin 
in those days yahweh began to cut off from israel and hazael struck them in all the borders of israel 
from the jordan eastward all the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and the manassites from aroer which is by the valley of the arnon even gilead and bashan 
now the rest of the acts of jehu and all that he did and all his might aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
jehu slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria jehoahaz his son reigned in his place 
the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twenty eight years 
now when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal 
but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziah took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him away from among the king s sons who were slain even him and his nurse and put them in the bedroom and they hid him from athaliah so that he was not slain 
he was with her hidden in the house of yahweh six years athaliah reigned over the land 
in the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the carites and of the guard and brought them to him into the house of yahweh and he made a covenant with them and took an oath of them in the house of yahweh and showed them the king s son 
he commanded them saying this is the thing that you shall do a third part of you who come in on the sabbath shall be keepers of the watch of the king s house 
a third part shall be at the gate sur and a third part at the gate behind the guard so you shall keep the watch of the house and be a barrier 
the two companies of you even all who go out on the sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of yahweh around the king 
you shall surround the king every man with his weapons in his hand and he who comes within the ranks let him be slain be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in 
the captains over hundreds did according to all that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men those who were to come in on the sabbath with those who were to go out on the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest 
the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king david s which were in the house of yahweh 
the guard stood every man with his weapons in his hand from the right side of the house to the left side of the house along by the altar and the house around the king 
then he brought out the king s son and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony and they made him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said long live the king ! 
when athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people she came to the people into the house of yahweh 
and she looked and behold the king stood by the pillar as the tradition was and the captains and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets then athaliah tore her clothes and cried treason ! treason ! 
jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army and said to them bring her out between the ranks kill him who follows her with the sword for the priest said don t let her be slain in the house of yahweh 
so they made way for her and she went by the way of the horses entry to the king s house she was slain there 
jehoiada made a covenant between yahweh and the king and the people that they should be yahweh s people between the king also and the people 
all the people of the land went to the house of baal and broke it down his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly and killed mattan the priest of baal before the altars the priest appointed officers over the house of yahweh 
he took the captains over hundreds and the carites and the guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king from the house of yahweh and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king s house he sat on the throne of the kings 
so all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king s house 
jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign 
in the seventh year of jehu began jehoash to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem and his mother s name was zibiah of beersheba 
jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh all his days in which jehoiada the priest instructed him 
however the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places 
but it was so that in the three and twentieth year of king jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house 
then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest and for the other priests and said to them why don t you repair the breaches of the house ? now therefore take no more money from your treasurers but deliver it for the breaches of the house 
the priests consented that they should take no more money from the people neither repair the breaches of the house 
but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid and set it beside the altar on the right side as one comes into the house of yahweh and the priests who kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of yahweh 
it was so when they saw that there was much money in the chest that the king s scribe and the high priest came up and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of yahweh 
they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work who had the oversight of the house of yahweh and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked on the house of yahweh 
and to the masons and the stone cutters and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of yahweh and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it 
moreover they didn t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work for they dealt faithfully 
the money for the trespass offerings and the money for the sin offerings was not brought into the house of yahweh it was the priests 
then hazael king of syria went up and fought against gath and took it and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem 
jehoash king of judah took all the holy things that jehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers kings of judah had dedicated and his own holy things and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of yahweh and of the king s house and sent it to hazael king of syria and he went away from jerusalem 
now the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
his servants arose and made a conspiracy and struck joash at the house of millo on the way that goes down to silla 
for jozacar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of shomer his servants struck him and he died and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son reigned in his place 
in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel in samaria for seventeen years 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh and followed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat with which he made israel to sin he didn t depart from it 
the anger of yahweh was kindled against israel and he delivered them into the hand of hazael king of syria and into the hand of benhadad the son of hazael continually 
jehoahaz begged yahweh and yahweh listened to him for he saw the oppression of israel how that the king of syria oppressed them 
 yahweh gave israel a savior so that they went out from under the hand of the syrians and the children of israel lived in their tents as before 
nevertheless they didn t depart from the sins of the house of jeroboam with which he made israel to sin but walked therein and there remained the asherah also in samaria 
for he didn t leave to jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen for the king of syria destroyed them and made them like the dust in threshing 
now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all that he did and his might aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
jehoahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria and joash his son reigned in his place 
in the thirty seventh year of joash king of judah jehoash the son of jehoahaz began to reign over israel in samaria for sixteen years 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh he didn t depart from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat with which he made israel to sin but he walked therein 
now the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did and his might with which he fought against amaziah king of judah aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
joash slept with his fathers and jeroboam sat on his throne and joash was buried in samaria with the kings of israel 
now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died and joash the king of israel came down to him and wept over him and said my father my father the chariots of israel and its horsemen ! 
elisha said to him take bow and arrows and he took to him bow and arrows 
he said to the king of israel put your hand on the bow and he put his hand on it elisha laid his hands on the king s hands 
he said open the window eastward and he opened it then elisha said shoot ! and he shot he said yahweh s arrow of victory even the arrow of victory over syria for you shall strike the syrians in aphek until you have consumed them 
he said take the arrows and he took them he said to the king of israel strike the ground and he struck three times and stopped 
the man of god was angry with him and said you should have struck five or six times then you would have struck syria until you had consumed it whereas now you shall strike syria just three times 
elisha died and they buried him now the bands of the moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year 
it happened as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band and they cast the man into the tomb of elisha and as soon as the man touched the bones of elisha he revived and stood up on his feet 
hazael king of syria oppressed israel all the days of jehoahaz 
but yahweh was gracious to them and had compassion on them and had respect to them because of his covenant with abraham isaac and jacob and would not destroy them neither cast he them from his presence as yet 
hazael king of syria died and benhadad his son reigned in his place 
jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again out of the hand of benhadad the son of hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of jehoahaz his father by war joash struck him three times and recovered the cities of israel 
in the second year of joash son of joahaz king of israel began amaziah the son of joash king of judah to reign 
he was twenty five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty nine years in jerusalem and his mother s name was jehoaddin of jerusalem 
he did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh yet not like david his father he did according to all that joash his father had done 
however the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places 
it happened as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father 
but the children of the murderers he didn t put to death according to that which is written in the book of the law of moses as yahweh commanded saying the fathers shall not be put to death for the children nor the children be put to death for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin 
he killed of edom in the valley of salt ten thousand and took sela by war and called its name joktheel to this day 
then amaziah sent messengers to jehoash the son of jehoahaz son of jehu king of israel saying come let us look one another in the face 
jehoash the king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give your daughter to my son as wife then a wild animal that was in lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle 
you have indeed struck edom and your heart has lifted you up enjoy the glory of it and stay at home for why should you meddle to your harm that you should fall even you and judah with you ? 
but amaziah would not listen so jehoash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at beth shemesh which belongs to judah 
judah was defeated by israel and they fled every man to his tent 
jehoash king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of jehoash the son of ahaziah at beth shemesh and came to jerusalem and broke down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubits 
he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of yahweh and in the treasures of the king s house the hostages also and returned to samaria 
now the rest of the acts of jehoash which he did and his might and how he fought with amaziah king of judah aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?

he was twenty five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and his mother s name was jerusha the daughter of zadok 
he did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh he did according to all that his father uzziah had done 
however the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places he built the upper gate of the house of yahweh 
now the rest of the acts of jotham and all that he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
in those days yahweh began to send against judah rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah 
jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and ahaz his son reigned in his place 
in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham king of judah began to reign 
twenty years old was ahaz when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and he didn t do that which was right in the eyes of yahweh his god like david his father 
but he walked in the way of the kings of israel yes and made his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the nations whom yahweh cast out from before the children of israel 
he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree 
then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to war and they besieged ahaz but could not overcome him 
at that time rezin king of syria recovered elath to syria and drove the jews from elath and the syrians came to elath and lived there to this day 
so ahaz sent messengers to tiglath pileser king of assyria saying i am your servant and your son come up and save me out of the hand of the king of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel who rise up against me 
ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of yahweh and in the treasures of the king s house and sent it for a present to the king of assyria 
the king of assyria listened to him and the king of assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried its people captive to kir and killed rezin 
king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglath pileser king of assyria and saw the altar that was at damascus and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and its pattern according to all its workmanship 
urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king ahaz had sent from damascus so urijah the priest made it for the coming of king ahaz from damascus 
when the king had come from damascus the king saw the altar and the king drew near to the altar and offered on it 
he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar 
the bronze altar which was before yahweh he brought from the forefront of the house from between his altar and the house of yahweh and put it on the north side of his altar 
king ahaz commanded urijah the priest saying on the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meal offering and the king s burnt offering and his meal offering with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meal offering and their drink offerings and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by 
urijah the priest did so according to all that king ahaz commanded 
king ahaz cut off the panels of the bases and removed the basin from off them and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a pavement of stone 
the covered way for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the king s entry outside turned he to the house of yahweh because of the king of assyria 
now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and hezekiah his son reigned in his place 
in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah hoshea the son of elah began to reign in samaria over israel for nine years 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh yet not as the kings of israel who were before him 
against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea became his servant and brought him tribute 
the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt and offered no tribute to the king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of assyria shut him up and bound him in prison 
then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to samaria and besieged it three years 
in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and carried israel away to assyria and placed them in halah and on the habor the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes 
it was so because the children of israel had sinned against yahweh their god who brought them up out of the land of egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had feared other gods 
and walked in the statutes of the nations whom yahweh cast out from before the children of israel and of the kings of israel which they made 
the children of israel did secretly things that were not right against yahweh their god and they built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city 
and they set them up pillars and asherim on every high hill and under every green tree 
and there they burnt incense in all the high places as did the nations whom yahweh carried away before them and they worked wicked things to provoke yahweh to anger 
and they served idols of which yahweh had said to them you shall not do this thing 
yet yahweh testified to israel and to judah by every prophet and every seer saying turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you by my servants the prophets 
notwithstanding they would not listen but hardened their neck like the neck of their fathers who didn t believe in yahweh their god 
they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified to them and they followed vanity and became vain and followed the nations that were around them concerning whom yahweh had commanded them that they should not do like them 
they forsook all the commandments of yahweh their god and made them molten images even two calves and made an asherah and worshiped all the army of the sky and served baal 
they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of yahweh to provoke him to anger 
therefore yahweh was very angry with israel and removed them out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only 
also judah didn t keep the commandments of yahweh their god but walked in the statutes of israel which they made 
yahweh rejected all the seed of israel and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast them out of his sight 
for he tore israel from the house of david and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drove israel from following yahweh and made them sin a great sin 
the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did they didn t depart from them 
until yahweh removed israel out of his sight as he spoke by all his servants the prophets so israel was carried away out of their own land to assyria to this day 
the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from cuthah and from avva and from hamath and sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel and they possessed samaria and lived in the cities of it 
so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they didn t fear yahweh therefore yahweh sent lions among them which killed some of them 
therefore they spoke to the king of assyria saying the nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities of samaria don t know the law of the god of the land therefore he has sent lions among them and behold they kill them because they don t know the law of the god of the land 
then the king of assyria commanded saying carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the law of the god of the land 
so one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria came and lived in bethel and taught them how they should fear yahweh 
however every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation in their cities in which they lived 
the men of babylon made succoth benoth and the men of cuth made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima 
and the avvites made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim 
so they feared yahweh and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places 
they feared yahweh and served their own gods after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away 
to this day they do what they did before they don t fear yahweh neither do they follow their statutes or their ordinances or the law or the commandment which yahweh commanded the children of jacob whom he named israel 
with whom yahweh had made a covenant and commanded them saying you shall not fear other gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them 
but you shall fear yahweh who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm and you shall bow yourselves to him and you shall sacrifice to him 
the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you you shall observe to do forevermore you shall not fear other gods 
you shall not forget the covenant that i have made with you neither shall you fear other gods 
but you shall fear yahweh your god and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies 
however they did not listen but they did what they did before 
so these nations feared yahweh and served their engraved images their children likewise and their children s children as their fathers did so they do to this day 
now it happened in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign 
he was twenty five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty nine years in jerusalem and his mother s name was abi the daughter of zechariah 
he did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh according to all that david his father had done 
he removed the high places and broke the pillars and cut down the asherah and he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that moses had made for in those days the children of israel burned incense to it and he called it nehushtan 
he trusted in yahweh the god of israel so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah nor among them that were before him 
for he joined with yahweh he didn t depart from following him but kept his commandments which yahweh commanded moses 
yahweh was with him wherever he went forth he prospered and he rebelled against the king of assyria and didn t serve him 
he struck the philistines to gaza and its borders from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city 
it happened in the fourth year of king hezekiah which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it 
at the end of three years they took it in the sixth year of hezekiah which was the ninth year of hoshea king of israel samaria was taken 
the king of assyria carried israel away to assyria and put them in halah and on the habor the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes 
because they didn t obey the voice of yahweh their god but transgressed his covenant even all that moses the servant of yahweh commanded and would not hear it nor do it 
now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the fortified cities of judah and took them 
hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish saying i have offended return from me that which you put on me i will bear the king of assyria appointed to hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold 
hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of yahweh and in the treasures of the king s house 
at that time hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of yahweh s temple and from the pillars which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria 
the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great army to jerusalem they went up and came to jerusalem when they had come up they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the highway of the fuller s field 
when they had called to the king there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the household and shebnah the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder 
rabshakeh said to them say now to hezekiah thus says the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this in which you trust ?
you say but they are but vain words there is counsel and strength for war now on whom do you trust that you have rebelled against me ?
now behold you trust in the staff of this bruised reed even in egypt if a man leans on it it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all who trust on him 
but if you tell me we trust in yahweh our god isn t that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah has taken away and has said to judah and to jerusalem you shall worship before this altar in jerusalem ? 
now therefore please give pledges to my master the king of assyria and i will give you two thousand horses if you are able on your part to set riders on them 
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master s servants and put your trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
have i now come up without yahweh against this place to destroy it ? yahweh said to me go up against this land and destroy it 
then eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebnah and joah said to rabshakeh please speak to your servants in the syrian language for we understand it don t speak with us in the jews language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall 
but rabshakeh said to them has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words ? hasn t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall to eat their own dung and to drink their own water with you ? 
then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and spoke saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyria 
thus says the king don t let hezekiah deceive you for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand 
neither let hezekiah make you trust in yahweh saying yahweh will surely deliver us and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria 
don t listen to hezekiah for thus says the king of assyria make your peace with me and come out to me and everyone of you eat of his vine and everyone of his fig tree and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern 
until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of olive trees and of honey that you may live and not die don t listen to hezekiah when he persuades you saying yahweh will deliver us 
has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria ?
where are the gods of hamath and of arpad ? where are the gods of sepharvaim of hena and ivvah ? have they delivered samaria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of my hand that yahweh should deliver jerusalem out of my hand ? 
but the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the king s commandment was don t answer him 
then eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the household came with shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of rabshakeh 
it happened when king hezekiah heard it that he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of yahweh 
he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz 
they said to him thus says hezekiah this day is a day of trouble of rebuke and of rejection for the children have come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them 
it may be yahweh your god will hear all the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master has sent to defy the living god and will rebuke the words which yahweh your god has heard therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left 
so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah 
isaiah said to them thus you shall tell your master thus says yahweh don t be afraid of the words that you have heard with which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me 
behold i will put a spirit in him and he will hear news and will return to his own land i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land 
so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he had departed from lachish 
when he heard it said of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he has come out to fight against you he sent messengers again to hezekiah saying 
 thus you shall speak to hezekiah king of judah saying don t let your god in whom you trust deceive you saying jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of assyria 
behold you have heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly will you be delivered ?
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden that were in telassar ?
where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivvah ? 
hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it then hezekiah went up to the house of yahweh and spread it before yahweh 
hezekiah prayed before yahweh and said yahweh the god of israel who sit above the cherubim you are the god even you alone of all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth 
incline your ear yahweh and hear open your eyes yahweh and see hear the words of sennacherib with which he has sent to defy the living god 
truly yahweh the kings of assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands 
and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of men s hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them 
now therefore yahweh our god save us i beg you out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you yahweh are god alone 
then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus says yahweh the god of israel whereas you have prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard you 
this is the word that yahweh has spoken concerning him the virgin daughter of zion has despised you and ridiculed you the daughter of jerusalem has shaken her head at you 
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the holy one of israel 
by your messengers you have defied the lord and have said with the multitude of my chariots i have come up to the height of the mountains to the innermost parts of lebanon and i will cut down its tall cedars and its choice fir trees and i will enter into his farthest lodging place the forest of his fruitful field 
i have dug and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my feet will i dry up all the rivers of egypt 
haven t you heard how i have done it long ago and formed it of ancient times ? now have i brought it to pass that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps 
therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were like the grass of the field and like the green herb like the grass on the housetops and like grain blasted before it has grown up 
but i know your sitting down and your going out and your coming in and your raging against me 
because of your raging against me and because your arrogance has come up into my ears therefore will i put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips and i will turn you back by the way by which you came 
 this shall be the sign to you you shall eat this year that which grows of itself and in the second year that which springs of the same and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat its fruit 
the remnant that has escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward 
for out of jerusalem a remnant will go out and out of mount zion those who shall escape the zeal of yahweh will perform this 
 therefore thus says yahweh concerning the king of assyria he shall not come to this city nor shoot an arrow there neither shall he come before it with shield nor cast up a mound against it 
by the way that he came by the same shall he return and he shall not come to this city says yahweh 
 for i will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for my servant david s sake 
it happened that night that the angel of yahweh went out and struck one hundred eighty five thousand in the camp of the assyrians when men arose early in the morning behold these were all dead bodies 
so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and lived at nineveh 
it happened as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer struck him with the sword and they escaped into the land of ararat esar haddon his son reigned in his place 
in those days was hezekiah sick to death isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came to him and said to him thus says yahweh set your house in order for you shall die and not live 
then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to yahweh saying 
 remember now yahweh i beg you how i have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in your sight hezekiah wept bitterly 
it happened before isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city that the word of yahweh came to him saying 
 turn back and tell hezekiah the prince of my people thus says yahweh the god of david your father i have heard your prayer i have seen your tears behold i will heal you on the third day you shall go up to the house of yahweh 
i will add to your days fifteen years i will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria i will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant david s sake 
isaiah said take a cake of figs they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered 
hezekiah said to isaiah what shall be the sign that yahweh will heal me and that i shall go up to the house of yahweh the third day ? 
isaiah said this shall be the sign to you from yahweh that yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken shall the shadow go forward ten steps or go back ten steps ? 
hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps nay but let the shadow return backward ten steps 
isaiah the prophet cried to yahweh and he brought the shadow ten steps backward by which it had gone down on the dial of ahaz 
at that time berodach baladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present to hezekiah for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick 
hezekiah listened to them and showed them all the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah didn t show them 
then isaiah the prophet came to king hezekiah and said to him what did these men say ? from where did they come to you ? hezekiah said they have come from a far country even from babylon 
he said what have they seen in your house ? hezekiah answered they have seen all that is in my house there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shown them 
isaiah said to hezekiah hear the word of yahweh 
 behold the days come that all that is in your house and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left says yahweh 
 of your sons who shall issue from you whom you shall father shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon 
then hezekiah said to isaiah the word of yahweh which you have spoken is good he said moreover isn t it so if peace and truth shall be in my days ? 
now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and all his might and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
hezekiah slept with his fathers and manasseh his son reigned in his place 
manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty five years in jerusalem and his mother s name was hephzibah 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh after the abominations of the nations whom yahweh cast out before the children of israel 
for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made an asherah as did ahab king of israel and worshiped all the army of the sky and served them 
he built altars in the house of yahweh of which yahweh said i will put my name in jerusalem 
he built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of yahweh 
he made his son to pass through the fire and practiced sorcery and used enchantments and dealt with those who had familiar spirits and with wizards he worked much evil in the sight of yahweh to provoke him to anger 
he set the engraved image of asherah that he had made in the house of which yahweh said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel will i put my name forever 
neither will i cause the feet of israel to wander any more out of the land which i gave their fathers if only they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded them and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded them 
but they didn t listen and manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than the nations did whom yahweh destroyed before the children of israel 
yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets saying 
 because manasseh king of judah has done these abominations and has done wickedly above all that the amorites did who were before him and has made judah also to sin with his idols 
therefore thus says yahweh the god of israel behold i bring such evil on jerusalem and judah that whoever hears of it both his ears shall tingle 
i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and the plummet of the house of ahab and i will wipe jerusalem as a man wipes a dish wiping it and turning it upside down 
i will cast off the remnant of my inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies they will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies 
because they have done that which is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of egypt even to this day 
moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much until he had filled jerusalem from one end to another besides his sin with which he made judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of yahweh 
now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he sinned aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden of uzza and amon his son reigned in his place 
amon was twenty two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in jerusalem and his mother s name was meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh as manasseh his father did 
he walked in all the way that his father walked in and served the idols that his father served and worshiped them 
and he forsook yahweh the god of his fathers and didn t walk in the way of yahweh 
the servants of amon conspired against him and put the king to death in his own house 
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his place 
now the rest of the acts of amon which he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
he was buried in his tomb in the garden of uzza and josiah his son reigned in his place 
josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty one years in jerusalem and his mother s name was jedidah the daughter of adaiah of bozkath 
he did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh and walked in all the way of david his father and didn t turn aside to the right hand or to the left 
it happened in the eighteenth year of king josiah that the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the scribe to the house of yahweh saying 
 go up to hilkiah the high priest that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of yahweh which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people 
let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of yahweh and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of yahweh to repair the breaches of the house 
to the carpenters and to the builders and to the masons and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house 
however there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand for they dealt faithfully 
hilkiah the high priest said to shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of yahweh hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan and he read it 
shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the king word again and said your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of yahweh 
shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me shaphan read it before the king 
it happened when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he tore his clothes 
the king commanded hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of shaphan and achbor the son of micaiah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah the king s servant saying 
 go inquire of yahweh for me and for the people and for all judah concerning the words of this book that is found for great is the wrath of yahweh that is kindled against us because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book to do according to all that which is written concerning us 
so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and asaiah went to huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobe now she lived in jerusalem in the second quarter and they talked with her 
she said to them thus says yahweh the god of israel tell the man who sent you to me 
 thus says yahweh behold i will bring evil on this place and on its inhabitants even all the words of the book which the king of judah has read 
because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and it shall not be quenched 
 therefore behold i will gather you to your fathers and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace neither shall your eyes see all the evil which i will bring on this place they brought back this message to the king 
the king sent and they gathered to him all the elders of judah and of jerusalem 
the king went up to the house of yahweh and all the men of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of yahweh 
the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before yahweh to walk after yahweh and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book and all the people stood to the covenant 
the king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the threshold to bring forth out of yahweh s temple all the vessels that were made for baal and for the asherah and for all the army of the sky and he burned them outside of jerusalem in the fields of the kidron and carried their ashes to bethel 
he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of judah and in the places around jerusalem those also who burned incense to baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets and to all the army of the sky 
he brought out the asherah from the house of yahweh outside of jerusalem to the brook kidron and burned it at the brook kidron and beat it to dust and cast its dust on the graves of the common people 
he broke down the houses of the sodomites that were in the house of yahweh where the women wove hangings for the asherah 
he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from geba to beersheba and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of joshua the governor of the city which were on a man s left hand at the gate of the city 
nevertheless the priests of the high places didn t come up to the altar of yahweh in jerusalem but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers 
he defiled topheth which is in the valley of the children of hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to molech 
he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to the sun at the entrance of the house of yahweh by the room of nathan melech the officer who was in the court and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire 
the king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper room of ahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of yahweh and beat them down from there and cast their dust into the brook kidron 
the the king defiled the high places that were before jerusalem which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption which solomon the king of israel had built for ashtoreth the abomination of the sidonians and for chemosh the abomination of moab and for milcom the abomination of the children of ammon 
he broke in pieces the pillars and cut down the asherim and filled their places with the bones of men 
moreover the altar that was at bethel and the high place which jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin had made even that altar and the high place he broke down and he burned the high place and beat it to dust and burned the asherah 
as josiah turned himself he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain and he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar and defiled it according to the word of yahweh which the man of god proclaimed who proclaimed these things 
then he said what monument is that which i see ? the men of the city told him it is the tomb of the man of god who came from judah and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of bethel 
he said let him be ! let no man move his bones so they let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet who came out of samaria 
all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke yahweh to anger josiah took away and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in bethel 
he killed all the priests of the high places that were there on the altars and burned men s bones on them and he returned to jerusalem 
the king commanded all the people saying keep the passover to yahweh your god as it is written in this book of the covenant 
surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges who judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israel nor of the kings of judah 
but in the eighteenth year of king josiah was this passover kept to yahweh in jerusalem 
moreover josiah removed those who had familiar spirits and the wizards and the teraphim and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of judah and in jerusalem that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that hilkiah the priest found in the house of yahweh 
like him was there no king before him who turned to yahweh with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might according to all the law of moses neither after him arose there any like him 
notwithstanding yahweh didn t turn from the fierceness of his great wrath with which his anger was kindled against judah because of all the provocation with which manasseh had provoked him 
yahweh said i will remove judah also out of my sight as i have removed israel and i will cast off this city which i have chosen even jerusalem and the house of which i said my name shall be there 
now the rest of the acts of josiah and all that he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
in his days pharaoh necoh king of egypt went up against the king of assyria to the river euphrates and king josiah went against him and pharaoh necoh killed him at megiddo when he had seen him 
his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo and brought him to jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and anointed him and made him king in his father s place 
jehoahaz was twenty three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem and his mother s name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh according to all that his fathers had done 
pharaoh necoh put him in bonds at riblah in the land of hamath that he might not reign in jerusalem and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold 
pharaoh necoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in the place of josiah his father and changed his name to jehoiakim but he took jehoahaz away and he came to egypt and died there 
jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of pharaoh he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land of everyone according to his taxation to give it to pharaoh necoh 
jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mother s name was zebidah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh according to all that his fathers had done 
in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim became his servant three years then he turned and rebelled against him 
yahweh sent against him bands of the chaldeans and bands of the syrians and bands of the moabites and bands of the children of ammon and sent them against judah to destroy it according to the word of yahweh which he spoke by his servants the prophets 
surely at the commandment of yahweh came this on judah to remove them out of his sight for the sins of manasseh according to all that he did 
and also for the innocent blood that he shed for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood and yahweh would not pardon 
now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and all that he did aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
so jehoiakim slept with his fathers and jehoiachin his son reigned in his place 
the king of egypt didn t come again out of his land any more for the king of babylon had taken from the brook of egypt to the river euphrates all that pertained to the king of egypt 
jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem three months and his mother s name was nehushta the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh according to all that his father had done 
at that time the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up to jerusalem and the city was besieged 
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it 
and jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and his officers and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign 
he carried out there all the treasures of the house of yahweh and the treasures of the king s house and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in yahweh s temple as yahweh had said 
he carried away all jerusalem and all the princes and all the mighty men of valor even ten thousand captives and all the craftsmen and the smiths none remained except the poorest sort of the people of the land 
he carried away jehoiachin to babylon and the king s mother and the king s wives and his officers and the chief men of the land carried he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon 
all the men of might even seven thousand and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand all of them strong and apt for war even them the king of babylon brought captive to babylon 
the king of babylon made mattaniah jehoiachin s father s brother king is his place and changed his name to zedekiah 
zedekiah was twenty one years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mother s name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh according to all that jehoiakim had done 
for through the anger of yahweh it happened in jerusalem and judah until he had cast them out from his presence zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon 
it happened in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and encamped against it and they built forts against it around it 
so the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king zedekiah 
on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the land 
then a breach was made in the city and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls which was by the king s garden now the chaldeans were against the city around it and the king went by the way of the arabah 
but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of jericho and all his army was scattered from him 
then they took the king and carried him up to the king of babylon to riblah and they gave judgment on him 
they killed the sons of zedekiah before his eyes and put out the eyes of zedekiah and bound him in fetters and carried him to babylon 
now in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month which was the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan the captain of the guard a servant of the king of babylon to jerusalem 
he burnt the house of yahweh and the king s house and all the houses of jerusalem even every great house burnt he with fire 
all the army of the chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls around jerusalem 
nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city and those who fell away who fell to the king of babylon and the residue of the multitude 
but the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields 
the chaldeans broke up the pillars of brass that were in the house of yahweh and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of yahweh and carried the brass pieces to babylon 
they took away the pots the shovels the snuffers the spoons and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered 
the captain of the guard took away the fire pans the basins that which was of gold in gold and that which was of silver in silver 
the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the threshold 
and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war and five men of those who saw the king s face who were found in the city and the scribe the captain of the army who mustered the people of the land and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city 
as for the people who were left in the land of judah whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had left even over them he made gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan governor 
now when all the captains of the forces they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah governor they came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite and jaazaniah the son of the maacathite they and their men 
gedaliah swore to them and to their men and said to them don t be afraid because of the servants of the chaldeans dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you 
but it happened in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the royal seed came and ten men with him and struck gedaliah so that he died and the jews and the chaldeans that were with him at mizpah 
all the people both small and great and the captains of the forces arose and came to egypt for they were afraid of the chaldeans 
it happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month on the seven and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the year that he began to reign lifted up the head of jehoiachin king of judah out of prison 
and he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in babylon 
and changed his prison garments jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life 
and for his allowance there was a continual allowance given him of the king every day a portion all the days of his life

their brothers in their villages were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them

now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain on mount gilboa 
the philistines followed hard after saul and after his sons and the philistines killed jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the sons of saul 
the battle went hard against saul and the archers overtook him and he was distressed by reason of the archers 
then saul said to his armor bearer draw your sword and thrust me through with it lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me but his armor bearer would not for he was terrified therefore saul took his sword and fell on it 
when his armor bearer saw that saul was dead he likewise fell on his sword and died 
so saul died and his three sons and all his house died together 
when all the men of israel who were in the valley saw that they fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook their cities and fled and the philistines came and lived in them 
it happened on the next day when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his sons fallen on mount gilboa 
they stripped him and took his head and his armor and sent into the land of the philistines all around to carry the news to their idols and to the people 
they put his armor in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the house of dagon 
when all jabesh gilead heard all that the philistines had done to saul 
all the valiant men arose and took away the body of saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to jabesh and buried their bones under the oak in jabesh and fasted seven days 
so saul died for his trespass which he committed against yahweh because of the word of yahweh which he didn t keep and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit to inquire 
and didn t inquire of yahweh therefore he killed him and turned the kingdom to david the son of jesse 
then all israel gathered themselves to david to hebron saying behold we are your bone and your flesh 
in times past even when saul was king it was you who led out and brought in israel yahweh your god said to you you shall be shepherd of my people israel and you shall be prince over my people israel 
so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and david made a covenant with them in hebron before yahweh and they anointed david king over israel according to the word of yahweh by samuel 
david and all israel went to jerusalem the same is jebus and the jebusites the inhabitants of the land were there 
the inhabitants of jebus said to david you shall not come in here nevertheless david took the stronghold of zion the same is the city of david 
david said whoever strikes the jebusites first shall be chief and captain joab the son of zeruiah went up first and was made chief 
david lived in the stronghold therefore they called it the city of david 
he built the city all around from millo even around and joab repaired the rest of the city 
david grew greater and greater for yahweh of armies was with him 
now these are the chief of the mighty men whom david had who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom together with all israel to make him king according to the word of yahweh concerning israel 
this is the number of the mighty men whom david had jashobeam the son of a hachmonite the chief of the thirty he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time 
after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was one of the three mighty men 
he was with david at pasdammim and there the philistines were gathered together to battle where there was a plot of ground full of barley and the people fled from before the philistines 
they stood in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the philistines and yahweh saved them by a great victory 
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to david into the cave of adullam and the army of the philistines were encamped in the valley of rephaim 
david was then in the stronghold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem 
david longed and said oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate ! 
the three broke through the army of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david but david would not drink of it but poured it out to yahweh 
and said my god forbid it me that i should do this ! shall i drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy ? for they risked their lives to bring it therefore he would not drink it the three mighty men did these things 
abishai the brother of joab he was chief of the three for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them and had a name among the three 
of the three he was more honorable than the two and was made their captain however he didn t attain to the three 
benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done mighty deeds he killed the two sons of ariel of moab he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow 
he killed an egyptian a man of great stature five cubits high and in the egyptian s hand was a spear like a weaver s beam and he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptian s hand and killed him with his own spear 
benaiah the son of jehoiada did these things and had a name among the three mighty men

these of the sons of gad were captains of the army he who was least was equal to one hundred and the greatest to one thousand 
these are those who went over the jordan in the first month when it had overflowed all its banks and they put to flight all them of the valleys both toward the east and toward the west 
there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the stronghold to david 
david went out to meet them and answered them if you have come peaceably to me to help me my heart shall be knit to you but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries since there is no wrong in my hands may the god of our fathers look thereon and rebuke it 
then the spirit came on amasai who was chief of the thirty and he said we are yours david and on your side you son of jesse peace peace be to you and peace be to your helpers for your god helps you then david received them and made them captains of the band 
of manasseh also there fell away some to david when he came with the philistines against saul to battle but they didn t help them for the lords of the philistines sent him away after consultation saying he will fall away to his master saul to the jeopardy of our heads 
as he went to ziklag there fell to him of manasseh adnah and jozabad and jediael and michael and jozabad and elihu and zillethai captains of thousands who were of manasseh 
they helped david against the band of rovers for they were all mighty men of valor and were captains in the army 
for from day to day men came to david to help him until there was a great army like the army of god 
these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war who came to david to hebron to turn the kingdom of saul to him according to the word of yahweh 
the children of judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred armed for war 
of the children of simeon mighty men of valor for the war seven thousand and one hundred 
of the children of levi four thousand and six hundred 
jehoiada was the leader of the household of aaron and with him were three thousand and seven hundred 
and zadok a young man mighty of valor and of his father s house twenty two captains 
of the children of benjamin the brothers of saul three thousand for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of saul 
of the children of ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred mighty men of valor famous men in their fathers houses 
of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand who were mentioned by name to come and make david king 
of the children of issachar men who had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do their heads were two hundred and all their brothers were at their commandment 
of zebulun such as were able to go out in the army who could set the battle in array with all kinds of instruments of war fifty thousand and who could command and were not of double heart 
of naphtali one thousand captains and with them with shield and spear thirty seven thousand 
of the danites who could set the battle in array twenty eight thousand six hundred 
of asher such as were able to go out in the army who could set the battle in array forty thousand 
on the other side of the jordan of the reubenites and the gadites and of the half tribe of manasseh with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle one hundred twenty thousand 
all these being men of war who could order the battle array came with a perfect heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the rest also of israel were of one heart to make david king 
they were there with david three days eating and drinking for their brothers had made preparation for them 
moreover those who were near to them as far as issachar and zebulun and naphtali brought bread on donkeys and on camels and on mules and on oxen food of meal cakes of figs and clusters of raisins and wine and oil and cattle and sheep in abundance for there was joy in israel 
david consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds even with every leader 
david said to all the assembly of israel if it seems good to you and if it is of yahweh our god let us send abroad everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of israel with whom the priests and levites are in their cities that have suburbs that they may gather themselves to us 
and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we didn t seek it in the days of saul 
all the assembly said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people 
so david assembled all israel together from the shihor the brook of egypt even to the entrance of hamath to bring the ark of god from kiriath jearim 
david went up and all israel to baalah that is to kiriath jearim which belonged to judah to bring up from there the ark of god yahweh that sits above the cherubim that is called by the name 
they carried the ark of god on a new cart and brought it out of the house of abinadab and uzza and ahio drove the cart 
david and all israel played before god with all their might even with songs and with harps and with stringed instruments and with tambourines and with cymbals and with trumpets 
when they came to the threshing floor of chidon uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled 
the anger of yahweh was kindled against uzza and he struck him because he put forth his hand to the ark and there he died before god 
david was displeased because yahweh had broken forth on uzza and he called that place perez uzza to this day 
david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bring the ark of god home to me ? 
so david didn t move the ark to him into the city of david but carried it aside into the house of obed edom the gittite 
the ark of god remained with the family of obed edom in his house three months and yahweh blessed the house of obed edom and all that he had 
hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees and masons and carpenters to build him a house 
david perceived that yahweh had established him king over israel for his kingdom was exalted on high for his people israel s sake 
david took more wives at jerusalem and david became the father of more sons and daughters 
these are the names of the children whom he had in jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon 
and ibhar and elishua and elpelet 
and nogah and nepheg and japhia 
and elishama and beeliada and eliphelet 
when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard of it and went out against them 
now the philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of rephaim 
david inquired of god saying shall i go up against the philistines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? yahweh said to him go up for i will deliver them into your hand 
so they came up to baal perazim and david struck them there and david said god has broken my enemies by my hand like the breach of waters therefore they called the name of that place baal perazim 
they left their gods there and david gave commandment and they were burned with fire 
the philistines yet again made a raid in the valley 
david inquired again of god and god said to him you shall not go up after them turn away from them and come on them over against the mulberry trees 
it shall be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees that then you shall go out to battle for god has gone out before you to strike the army of the philistines 
david did as god commanded him and they struck the army of the philistines from gibeon even to gezer 
the fame of david went out into all lands and yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations 
david made him houses in the city of david and he prepared a place for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent 
then david said no one ought to carry the ark of god but the levites for yahweh has chosen them to carry the ark of god and to minister to him forever 
david assembled all israel at jerusalem to bring up the ark of yahweh to its place which he had prepared for it 
david gathered together the sons of aaron and the levites 
of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brothers one hundred twenty 
of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his brothers two hundred twenty 
of the sons of gershom joel the chief and his brothers one hundred thirty 
of the sons of elizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brothers two hundred 
of the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brothers eighty 
of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brothers one hundred twelve 
david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the levites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and amminadab 
and said to them you are the heads of the fathers households of the levites sanctify yourselves both you and your brothers that you may bring up the ark of yahweh the god of israel to the place that i have prepared for it 
for because you didn t carry it at first yahweh our god made broke out against us because we didn t seek him according to the ordinance 
so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of yahweh the god of israel 
the children of the levites bore the ark of god on their shoulders with the poles thereon as moses commanded according to the word of yahweh 
david spoke to the chief of the levites to appoint their brothers the singers with instruments of music stringed instruments and harps and cymbals sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy 
so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of his brothers asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their brothers ethan the son of kushaiah 
and with them their brothers of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah and mattithiah and eliphelehu and mikneiah and obed edom and jeiel the doorkeepers 
so the singers heman asaph and ethan were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud 
and zechariah and aziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah and benaiah with stringed instruments set to alamoth 
and mattithiah and eliphelehu and mikneiah and obed edom and jeiel and azaziah with harps tuned to the eight stringed lyre to lead 
chenaniah chief of the levites was over the song he instructed about the song because he was skillful 
berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark 
shebaniah and joshaphat and nethanel and amasai and zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests blew the trumpets before the ark of god and obed edom and jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark 
so david and the elders of israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of yahweh out of the house of obed edom with joy 
it happened when god helped the levites who bore the ark of the covenant of yahweh that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams 
david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the levites who bore the ark and the singers and chenaniah the master of the song with the singers and david had on him an ephod of linen 
thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of yahweh with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and with cymbals sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps 
it happened as the ark of the covenant of yahweh came to the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looked out at the window and saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart 
they brought in the ark of god and set it in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before god 
when david had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of yahweh 
he dealt to everyone of israel both man and woman to every one a loaf of bread and a portion of meat and a cake of raisins 
he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of yahweh and to celebrate and to thank and praise yahweh the god of israel 
asaph the chief and second to him zechariah jeiel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obed edom and jeiel with stringed instruments and with harps and asaph with cymbals sounding aloud 
and benaiah and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god 
then on that day david first ordained to give thanks to yahweh by the hand of asaph and his brothers 
oh give thanks to yahweh call on his name make his doings known among the peoples 
sing to him sing praises to him tell of all his marvelous works 
glory in his holy name let the heart of those who seek yahweh rejoice 
seek yahweh and his strength seek his face forever more 
remember his marvelous works that he has done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth 
you seed of israel his servant you children of jacob his chosen ones 
he is yahweh our god his judgments are in all the earth 
remember his covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations 
the covenant which he made with abraham his oath to isaac 
he confirmed the same to jacob for a statute and to israel for an everlasting covenant 
saying i will give you the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance 
when you were but a few men in number yes very few and foreigners were in it 
they went about from nation to nation from one kingdom to another people 
he allowed no man to do them wrong yes he reproved kings for their sakes 
 don t touch my anointed ones ! do my prophets no harm ! 
sing to yahweh all the earth ! display his salvation from day to day 
declare his glory among the nations and his marvelous works among all the peoples 
for great is yahweh and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods 
for all the gods of the peoples are idols but yahweh made the heavens 
honor and majesty are before him strength and gladness are in his place 
ascribe to yahweh you relatives of the peoples ascribe to yahweh glory and strength !
ascribe to yahweh the glory due to his name bring an offering and come before him worship yahweh in holy array 
tremble before him all the earth the world also is established that it can t be moved 
let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice ! let them say among the nations yahweh reigns ! 
let the sea roar and its fullness ! let the field exult and all that is therein !
then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before yahweh for he comes to judge the earth 
oh give thanks to yahweh for he is good for his loving kindness endures forever 
say save us god of our salvation ! gather us together and deliver us from the nations to give thanks to your holy name to triumph in your praise 
blessed be yahweh the god of israel from everlasting even to everlasting all the people said amen and praised yahweh 
so he left there before the ark of the covenant of yahweh asaph and his brothers to minister before the ark continually as every day s work required 
and obed edom with their brothers sixty eight obed edom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to be doorkeepers 
and zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of yahweh in the high place that was at gibeon 
to offer burnt offerings to yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening even according to all that is written in the law of yahweh which he commanded to israel 
and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest who were chosen who were mentioned by name to give thanks to yahweh because his loving kindness endures forever 
and with them heman and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud and with instruments for the songs of god and the sons of jeduthun to be at the gate 
all the people departed every man to his house and david returned to bless his house 
it happened when david lived in his house that david said to nathan the prophet behold i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of the covenant of yahweh is under curtains 
nathan said to david do all that is in your heart for god is with you 
it happened the same night that the word of god came to nathan saying 
 go and tell david my servant thus says yahweh you shall not build me a house to dwell in 
 now therefore you shall tell my servant david thus says yahweh of armies i took you from the sheep pen from following the sheep that you should be prince over my people israel 
i have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you i will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth 
i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in their own place and be moved no more neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at the first 
and from the day that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and i will subdue all your enemies moreover i tell you that yahweh will build you a house 
it shall happen when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers that i will set up your seed after you who shall be of your sons and i will establish his kingdom 
he shall build me a house and i will establish his throne forever 
i will be his father and he shall be my son i will not take my loving kindness away from him as i took it from him that was before you 
but i will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever his throne shall be established forever 
according to all these words and according to all this vision so nathan spoke to david 
then david the king went in and sat before yahweh and he said who am i yahweh god and what is my house that you have brought me thus far ?
this was a small thing in your eyes god but you have spoken of your servant s house for a great while to come and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree yahweh god 
what can david say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant ? for you know your servant 
yahweh for your servant s sake and according to your own heart you have worked all this greatness to make known all these great things 
yahweh there is none like you neither is there any god besides you according to all that we have heard with our ears 
what one nation in the earth is like your people israel whom god went to redeem to himself for a people to make you a name by great and awesome things in driving out nations from before your people whom you redeem out of egypt ?
for your people israel you made your own people forever and you yahweh became their god 
now yahweh let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established forever and do as you have spoken 
let your name be established and magnified forever saying yahweh of armies is the god of israel even a god to israel the house of david your servant is established before you 
for you my god have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you 
now yahweh you are god and have promised this good thing to your servant 
now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant that it may continue forever before you for you yahweh have blessed and it is blessed forever 
after this it happened that david struck the philistines and subdued them and took gath and its towns out of the hand of the philistines 
he struck moab and the moabites became servants to david and brought tribute 
david struck hadadezer king of zobah to hamath as he went to establish his dominion by the river euphrates 
david took from him one thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david hamstrung all the chariot horses but reserved of them for one hundred chariots 
when the syrians of damascus came to help hadadezer king of zobah david struck of the syrians twenty two thousand men 
then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians became servants to david and brought tribute yahweh gave victory to david wherever he went 
david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem 
from tibhath and from cun cities of hadadezer david took very much brass with which solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass 
when tou king of hamath heard that david had struck all the army of hadadezer king of zobah 
he sent hadoram his son to king david to greet him and to bless him because he had fought against hadadezer and struck him for hadadezer had wars with tou and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and brass 
king david also dedicated these to yahweh with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations from edom and from moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines and from amalek 
moreover abishai the son of zeruiah struck of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand 
he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites became servants to david yahweh gave victory to david wherever he went 
david reigned over all israel and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people 
joab the son of zeruiah was over the army and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder 
and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar were priests and shavsha was scribe 
and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of david were chief about the king 
it happened after this that nahash the king of the children of ammon died and his son reigned in his place 
david said i will show kindness to hanun the son of nahash because his father showed kindness to me so david sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father david s servants came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comfort him 
but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun do you think that david honors your father in that he has sent comforters to you ? haven t his servants come to you to search to overthrow and to spy out the land ? 
so hanun took david s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away 
then there went certain persons and told david how the men were served he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed the king said stay at jericho until your beards have grown and then return 
when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of mesopotamia and out of arammaacah and out of zobah 
so they hired for themselves thirty two thousand chariots and the king of maacah and his people who came and encamped before medeba the children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battle 
when david heard of it he sent joab and all the army of the mighty men 
the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the gate of the city and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field 
now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the syrians 
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of abishai his brother and they put themselves in array against the children of ammon 
he said if the syrians are too strong for me then you are to help me but if the children of ammon are too strong for you then i will help you 
be courageous and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our god may yahweh do that which seems good to him 
so joab and the people who were with him drew near before the syrians to the battle and they fled before him 
when the children of ammon saw that the syrians had fled they likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into the city then joab came to jerusalem 
when the syrians saw that they were defeated by israel they sent messengers and drew forth the syrians who were beyond the river with shophach the captain of the army of hadadezer at their head 
it was told david and he gathered all israel together and passed over the jordan and came on them and set the battle in array against them so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians they fought with him 
the syrians fled before israel and david killed of the syrians the men of seven thousand chariots and forty thousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the army 
it happened at the time of the return of the year at the time when kings go out that joab led forth the army and wasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besieged rabbah but david stayed at jerusalem joab struck rabbah and overthrew it 
david took the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in it and it was set on david s head and he brought forth the spoil of the city exceeding much 
he brought forth the people who were therein and cut them with saws and with iron picks and with axes david did so to all the cities of the children of ammon david and all the people returned to jerusalem 
it happened after this that there arose war at gezer with the philistines then sibbecai the hushathite killed sippai of the sons of the giant and they were subdued 
there was again war with the philistines and elhanan the son of jair killed lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weaver s beam 
there was again war at gath where there was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were twenty four six on each hand and six on each foot and he also was born to the giant 
when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimea david s brother killed him 
these were born to the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants 
satan stood up against israel and moved david to number israel 
david said to joab and to the princes of the people go number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring me word that i may know the sum of them 
joab said may yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are but my lord the king aren t they all my lord s servants ? why does my lord require this thing ? why will he be a cause of guilt to israel ? 
nevertheless the king s word prevailed against joab therefore joab departed and went throughout all israel and came to jerusalem 
joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to david all those of israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword and in judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword 
but he didn t count levi and benjamin among them for the king s word was abominable to joab 
god was displeased with this thing therefore he struck israel 
david said to god i have sinned greatly in that i have done this thing but now put away i beg you the iniquity of your servant for i have done very foolishly 
yahweh spoke to gad david s seer saying 
 go and speak to david saying thus says yahweh i offer you three things choose one of them that i may do it to you 
so gad came to david and said to him thus says yahweh take your choice 
either three years of famine or three months to be consumed before your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you or else three days the sword of yahweh even pestilence in the land and the angel of yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of israel now therefore consider what answer i shall return to him who sent me 
david said to gad i am in distress let me fall i pray into the hand of yahweh for his mercies are very great let me not fall into the hand of man 
so yahweh sent a pestilence on israel and seventy thousand men of israel fell 
god sent an angel to jerusalem to destroy it as he was about to destroy yahweh saw and he relented of the disaster and said to the destroying angel it is enough now stay your hand the angel of yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite 
david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of yahweh standing between earth and the sky having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the elders clothed in sackcloth fell on their faces 
david said to god isn t it i who commanded the people to be numbered ? it is even i who have sinned and done very wickedly but these sheep what have they done ? please let your hand o yahweh my god be against me and against my father s house but not against your people that they should be plagued 
then the angel of yahweh commanded gad to tell david that david should go up and raise an altar to yahweh in the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite 
david went up at the saying of gad which he spoke in the name of yahweh 
ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons who were with him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat 
as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and went out of the threshing floor and bowed himself to david with his face to the ground 
then david said to ornan give me the place of this threshing floor that i may build thereon an altar to yahweh you shall sell it to me for the full price that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people 
ornan said to david take it for yourself and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes behold i give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the meal offering i give it all 
king david said to ornan no but i will most certainly buy it for the full price for i will not take that which is yours for yahweh nor offer a burnt offering without cost 
so david gave to ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place 
david built an altar to yahweh there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on yahweh and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering 
yahweh commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into its sheath 
at that time when david saw that yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there 
for the tabernacle of yahweh which moses made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at gibeon 
but david couldn t go before it to inquire of god for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of yahweh 
then david said this is the house of yahweh god and this is the altar of burnt offering for israel 
david gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of israel and he set masons to cut worked stones to build god s house 
david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the couplings and brass in abundance without weight 
and cedar trees without number for the sidonians and they of tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to david 
david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house that is to be built for yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent of fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore make preparation for it so david prepared abundantly before his death 
then he called for solomon his son and commanded him to build a house for yahweh the god of israel 
david said to solomon his son as for me it was in my heart to build a house to the name of yahweh my god 
but the word of yahweh came to me saying you have shed blood abundantly and have made great wars you shall not build a house to my name because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight 
behold a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest i will give him rest from all his enemies all around for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness to israel in his days 
he shall build a house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever 
now my son may yahweh be with you and prosper you and build the house of yahweh your god as he has spoken concerning you 
may yahweh give you discretion and understanding and put you in charge of israel that so you may keep the law of yahweh your god 
then you will prosper if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which yahweh gave moses concerning israel be strong and courageous don t be afraid neither be dismayed 
now behold in my affliction i have prepared for the house of yahweh one hundred thousand talents of gold one million talents of silver and brass and iron without weight for it is in abundance i have also prepared timber and stone and you may add to them 
there are also workmen with you in abundance cutters and workers of stone and timber and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work 
of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is no number arise and be doing and may yahweh be with you 
david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon his son saying 
 isn t yahweh your god with you ? hasn t he given you rest on every side ? for he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand and the land is subdued before yahweh and before his people 
now set your heart and your soul to seek after yahweh your god arise therefore and build the sanctuary of yahweh god to bring the ark of the covenant of yahweh and the holy vessels of god into the house that is to be built to the name of yahweh 
now david was old and full of days and he made solomon his son king over israel 
he gathered together all the princes of israel with the priests and the levites 
the levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty eight thousand 
david said of these twenty four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of yahweh six thousand were officers and judges 
four thousand were doorkeepers and four thousand praised yahweh with the instruments which i made for giving praise 
david divided them into divisions according to the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari 
of the gershonites ladan and shimei 
the sons of ladan jehiel the chief and zetham and joel three 
the sons of shimei shelomoth and haziel and haran three these were the heads of the fathers households of ladan 
the sons of shimei jahath zina and jeush and beriah these four were the sons of shimei 
jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and beriah didn t have many sons therefore they became a fathers house in one reckoning 
the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four 
the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy things he and his sons forever to burn incense before yahweh to minister to him and to bless in his name forever 
but as for moses the man of god his sons were named among the tribe of levi

these were the sons of levi after their fathers houses even the heads of the fathers houses of those who were counted individually in the number of names by their polls who did the work for the service of the house of yahweh from twenty years old and upward 
for david said yahweh the god of israel has given rest to his people and he dwells in jerusalem forever 
also the levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service 
for by the last words of david the sons of levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward 
for their office was to wait on the sons of aaron for the service of the house of yahweh in the courts and in the rooms and in the purifying of all holy things even the work of the service of god s house

these were the divisions of the sons of aaron the sons of aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar

there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than of the sons of ithamar and they were divided like this of the sons of eleazar there were sixteen heads of fathers houses and of the sons of ithamar according to their fathers houses eight 
thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots for there were princes of the sanctuary and princes of god both of the sons of eleazar and of the sons of ithamar

joab the son of zeruiah began to number but didn t finish and there came wrath for this on israel neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king david

then david the king stood up on his feet and said hear me my brothers and my people ! as for me it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of yahweh and for the footstool of our god and i had prepared for the building 
but god said to me you shall not build a house for my name because you are a man of war and have shed blood 
however yahweh the god of israel chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over israel forever for he has chosen judah to be prince and in the house of judah the house of my father and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all israel 
of all my sons for yahweh has given me many sons he has chosen solomon my son to sit on the throne of yahweh s kingdom over israel 
he said to me solomon your son shall build my house and my courts for i have chosen him to be my son and i will be his father 
i will establish his kingdom forever if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances as at this day 
now therefore in the sight of all israel the assembly of yahweh and in the audience of our god observe and seek out all the commandments of yahweh your god that you may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever 
you solomon my son know the god of your father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for yahweh searches all hearts and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts if you seek him he will be found by you but if you forsake him he will cast you off forever 
take heed now for yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary be strong and do it 
then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple and of its houses and of its treasuries and of the upper rooms of it and of the inner rooms of it and of the place of the mercy seat 
and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit for the courts of the house of yahweh and for all the surrounding rooms for the treasuries of god s house and for the treasuries of the dedicated things 
also for the divisions of the priests and the levites and for all the work of the service of the house of yahweh and for all the vessels of service in the house of yahweh

and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight and gold for the pattern of the chariot the cherubim that spread out and covered the ark of the covenant of yahweh 
 all this said david i have been made to understand in writing from the hand of yahweh even all the works of this pattern 
david said to solomon his son be strong and courageous and do it don t be afraid nor be dismayed for yahweh god even my god is with you he will not fail you nor forsake you until all the work for the service of the house of yahweh is finished 
behold there are the divisions of the priests and the levites for all the service of god s house there shall be with you in all kinds of work every willing man who has skill for any kind of service also the captains and all the people will be entirely at your command 
david the king said to all the assembly solomon my son whom alone god has chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for yahweh god 
now i have prepared with all my might for the house of my god the
gold for the things of gold 
and the silver for the things of silver 
and the brass for the things of brass 
the iron for the things of iron 
and wood for the things of wood 
onyx stones and stones to be set stones for inlaid work and of various colors and all kinds of precious stones and marble stones in abundance 
in addition because i have set my affection on the house of my god since i have a treasure of my own of gold and silver i give it to the house of my god over and above all that i have prepared for the holy house 
even three thousand talents of gold of the gold of ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver with which to overlay the walls of the houses 
of gold for the things of gold and of silver for the things of silver and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to yahweh ? 
then the princes of the fathers households and the princes of the tribes of israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the rulers over the king s work offered willingly 
and they gave for the service of god s house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics and of silver ten thousand talents and of brass eighteen thousand talents and of iron a hundred thousand talents 
they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of yahweh under the hand of jehiel the gershonite 
then the people rejoiced because they offered willingly because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to yahweh and david the king also rejoiced with great joy 
therefore david blessed yahweh before all the assembly and david said you are blessed yahweh the god of israel our father forever and ever 
yours yahweh is the greatness the power the glory the victory and the majesty ! for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours yours is the kingdom yahweh and you are exalted as head above all 
both riches and honor come from you and you rule over all and in your hand is power and might and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all 
now therefore our god we thank you and praise your glorious name 
but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly as this ? for all things come from you and of your own have we given you 
for we are strangers before you and foreigners as all our fathers were our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is no remaining 
yahweh our god all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own 
i know also my god that you try the heart and have pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of my heart i have willingly offered all these things now have i seen with joy your people that are present here offer willingly to you 
yahweh the god of abraham of isaac and of israel our fathers keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people and prepare their heart for you 
and give to solomon my son a perfect heart to keep your commandments your testimonies and your statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for which i have made provision 
david said to all the assembly now bless yahweh your god ! all the assembly blessed yahweh the god of their fathers and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before yahweh and the king 
they sacrificed sacrifices to yahweh and offered burnt offerings to yahweh on the next day after that day even one thousand bulls one thousand rams and one thousand lambs with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all israel 
and ate and drink before yahweh on that day with great gladness they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed him to yahweh to be prince and zadok to be priest 
then solomon sat on the throne of yahweh as king instead of david his father and prospered and all israel obeyed him 
all the princes the mighty men and also all of the sons of king david submitted themselves to solomon the king 
yahweh magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all israel and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in israel 
now david the son of jesse reigned over all israel 
the time that he reigned over israel was forty years he reigned seven years in hebron and he reigned thirty three years in jerusalem 
he died in a good old age full of days riches and honor and solomon his son reigned in his place 
now the acts of david the king first and last behold they are written in the history of samuel the seer and in the history of nathan the prophet and in the history of gad the seer 
with all his reign and his might and the times that went over him and over israel and over all the kingdoms of the countries 
solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and yahweh his god was with him and magnified him exceedingly 
solomon spoke to all israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every prince in all israel the heads of the fathers households 
so solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place that was at gibeon for there was the tent of meeting of god which moses the servant of yahweh had made in the wilderness 
but david had brought the ark of god up from kiriath jearim to the place that david had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for it at jerusalem 
moreover the bronze altar that bezalel the son of uri the son of hur had made was there before the tabernacle of yahweh and solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there 
solomon went up there to the bronze altar before yahweh which was at the tent of meeting and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it 
in that night god appeared to solomon and said to him ask what i shall give you 
solomon said to god you have shown great loving kindness to david my father and have made me king in his place 
now yahweh god let your promise to david my father be established for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude 
now give me wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this your people that is so great ? 
god said to solomon because this was in your heart and you have not asked riches wealth or honor nor the life of those who hate you neither yet have asked long life but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may judge my people over whom i have made you king 
wisdom and knowledge is granted to you i will give you riches wealth and honor such as none of the kings have had who have been before you neither shall there any after you have the like 
so solomon came from the high place that was at gibeon from before the tent of meeting to jerusalem and he reigned over israel 
solomon gathered chariots and horsemen and he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem 
the king made silver and gold to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland for abundance 
the horses which solomon had were brought out of egypt and from kue the king s merchants purchased them from kue 
they brought up and brought out of egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver and a horse for one hundred fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and the kings of syria they brought them out by their means 
now solomon purposed to build a house for the name of yahweh and a house for his kingdom 
solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens and eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them 
solomon sent to huram the king of tyre saying as you dealt with david my father and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell so deal with me 
behold i am about to build a house for the name of yahweh my god to dedicate it to him and to burn before him incense of sweet spices and for the continual show bread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the set feasts of yahweh our god this is an ordinance forever to israel 
 the house which i build is great for our god is great above all gods 
but who is able to build him a house since heaven and the heaven of heavens can t contain him ? who am i then that i should build him a house except just to burn incense before him ?
 now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and who knows how to engrave engravings to be with the skillful men who are with me in judah and in jerusalem whom david my father provided 
 send me also cedar trees fir trees and algum trees out of lebanon for i know that your servants know how to cut timber in lebanon and behold my servants shall be with your servants 
even to prepare me timber in abundance for the house which i am about to build shall be great and wonderful 
behold i will give to your servants the cutters who cut timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil 
then huram the king of tyre answered in writing which he sent to solomon because yahweh loves his people he has made you king over them 
huram continued blessed be yahweh the god of israel that made heaven and earth who has given to david the king a wise son endowed with discretion and understanding that should build a house for yahweh and a house for his kingdom 
now i have sent a skillful man endowed with understanding of huram my father s 
the son of a woman of the daughters of dan 
and his father was a man of tyre 
skillful to work in gold and in silver in brass in iron in stone and in timber 
in purple in blue and in fine linen and in crimson 
also to engrave any kind of engraving and to devise any device 
that there may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men and with the skillful men of my lord david your father 
 now therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine which my lord has spoken of let him send to his servants 
and we will cut wood out of lebanon as much as you shall need and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to joppa and you shall carry it up to jerusalem 
solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of israel after the numbering with which david his father had numbered them and they were found one hundred fifty three thousand six hundred 
he set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work 
then solomon began to build the house of yahweh at jerusalem on mount moriah where yahweh appeared to david his father which he prepared in the place that david had appointed in the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite 
he began to build in the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign 
now these are the foundations which solomon laid for the building of god s house the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits and the breadth twenty cubits 
the porch that was in front its length according to the breadth of the house was twenty cubits and the height one hundred twenty and he overlaid it within with pure gold 
the greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood which he overlaid with fine gold and ornamented it with palm trees and chains 
he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and the gold was gold of parvaim 
he overlaid also the house the beams the thresholds and its walls and its doors with gold and engraved cherubim on the walls 
he made the most holy house its length according to the breadth of the house was twenty cubits and its breadth twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six hundred talents 
the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold he overlaid the upper rooms with gold 
in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work and they overlaid them with gold 
the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long the wing of the one was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits reaching to the wing of the other cherub 
the wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits joining to the wing of the other cherub 
the wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were toward the house 
he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and ornamented it with cherubim 
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty five cubits high and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits 
he made chains in the oracle and put them on the tops of the pillars and he made one hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains 
he set up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the right hand jachin and the name of that on the left boaz 
then he made an altar of brass twenty cubits its length and twenty cubits its breadth and ten cubits its height 
also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and its height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits encircled it 
under it was the likeness of oxen which encircled it for ten cubits encircling the sea the oxen were in two rows cast when it was cast 
it stood on twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set on them above and all their hinder parts were inward 
it was a handbreadth thick and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup like the flower of a lily it received and held three thousand baths 
he made also ten basins and put five on the right hand and five on the left to wash in them such things as belonged to the burnt offering they washed in them but the sea was for the priests to wash in 
he made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them and he set them in the temple five on the right hand and five on the left 
he made also ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left he made one hundred basins of gold 
furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid their doors with brass 
he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward toward the south 
huram made the pots and the shovels and the basins so huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king solomon in god s house 
the two pillars and the bowls and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars 
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars 
he made also the bases and the basins made he on the bases 
one sea and the twelve oxen under it 
huram his father also made the pots the shovels the forks and all its vessels for king solomon for the house of yahweh of bright brass 
the king cast them in the plain of the jordan in the clay ground between succoth and zeredah 
thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance for the weight of the brass could not be found out 
solomon made all the vessels that were in god s house the golden altar also and the tables with the show bread on them 
and the lampstands with their lamps to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle of pure gold 
and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold and that perfect gold 
and the snuffers and the basins and the spoons and the fire pans of pure gold and as for the entry of the house the inner doors of it for the most holy place and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold 
thus all the work that solomon did for the house of yahweh was finished solomon brought in the things that david his father had dedicated even the silver and the gold and all the vessels and put them in the treasuries of the house of god 
then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the princes of the fathers households of the children of israel to jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of yahweh out of the city of david which is zion 
and all the men of israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast which was in the seventh month 
all the elders of israel came and the levites took up the ark 
and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels that were in the tent these the priests the levites brought up 
king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled to him were before the ark sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude 
the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of yahweh to its place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubim 
for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above 
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not seen outside and there it is to this day 
there was nothing in the ark except the two tables which moses put at horeb when yahweh made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of egypt 
it happened when the priests had come out of the holy place for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves and didn t keep their divisions 
also the levites who were the singers all of them even asaph heman jeduthun and their sons and their brothers arrayed in fine linen with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets 
it happened when the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking yahweh and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music and praised yahweh saying for he is good for his loving kindness endures forever ! that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of yahweh 
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of yahweh filled god s house 
then solomon said yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness 
but i have built you a house of habitation and a place for you to dwell in forever 
the king turned his face and blessed all the assembly of israel and all the assembly of israel stood 
he said blessed be yahweh the god of israel who spoke with his mouth to david my father and has with his hands fulfilled it saying 
 since the day that i brought forth my people out of the land of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build a house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man to be prince over my people israel 
but i have chosen jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen david to be over my people israel 
now it was in the heart of david my father to build a house for the name of yahweh the god of israel 
but yahweh said to david my father whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name you did well that it was in your heart 
nevertheless you shall not build the house but your son who shall come forth out of your body he shall build the house for my name 
 yahweh has performed his word that he spoke for i have risen up in the place of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as yahweh promised and have built the house for the name of yahweh the god of israel 
there i have set the ark in which is the covenant of yahweh which he made with the children of israel 
he stood before the altar of yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of israel and spread forth his hands
 for solomon had made a bronze scaffold five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court and on it he stood and kneeled down on his knees before all the assembly of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven 
and he said yahweh the god of israel there is no god like you in heaven or on earth you who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants who walk before you with all their heart 
who have kept with your servant david my father that which you promised him yes you spoke with your mouth and have fulfilled it with your hand as it is this day 
 now therefore yahweh the god of israel keep with your servant david my father that which you have promised him saying there shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel if only your children take heed to their way to walk in my law as you have walked before me 
now therefore yahweh the god of israel let your word be verified which you spoke to your servant david 
 but will god indeed dwell with men on the earth ? behold heaven and the heaven of heavens can t contain you how much less this house which i have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant and to his supplication yahweh my god to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you 
that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place 
listen to the petitions of your servant and of your people israel when they shall pray toward this place yes hear from your dwelling place even from heaven and when you hear forgive 
 if a man sin against his neighbor and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear and he comes and swears before your altar in this house 
then hear from heaven and do and judge your servants bringing retribution to the wicked to bring his way on his own head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness 
 if your people israel be struck down before the enemy because they have sinned against you and shall turn again and confess your name and pray and make supplication before you in this house 
then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people israel and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers 
 when the sky is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you if they pray toward this place and confess your name and turn from their sin when you afflict them 
then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and of your people israel when you teach them the good way in which they should walk and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for an inheritance 
 if there is famine in the land if there is pestilence if there is blight or mildew locust or caterpillar if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities whatever plague or whatever sickness there is 
whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man or by all your people israel who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow and shall spread forth his hands toward this house 
then hear from heaven your dwelling place and forgive and render to every man according to all his ways whose heart you know for you even you only know the hearts of the children of men 
that they may fear you to walk in your ways so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers 
 moreover concerning the foreigner who is not of your people israel when he shall come from a far country for your great name s sake and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm when they shall come and pray toward this house 
then hear from heaven even from your dwelling place and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you as does your people israel and that they may know that this house which i have built is called by your name 
 if your people go out to battle against their enemies by whatever way you shall send them and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen and the house which i have built for your name 
then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause 
 if they sin against you for there is no man who doesn t sin and you are angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near 
yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive and turn again and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity saying we have sinned we have done perversely and have dealt wickedly 
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity where they have carried them captive and pray toward their land which you gave to their fathers and the city which you have chosen and toward the house which i have built for your name 
then hear from heaven even from your dwelling place their prayer and their petitions and maintain their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you 
 now my god let i beg you your eyes be open and let your ears be attentive to the prayer that is made in this place 
 now therefore arise yahweh god into your resting place you and the ark of your strength let your priests yahweh god be clothed with salvation and let your saints rejoice in goodness 
 yahweh god don t turn away the face of your anointed remember your loving kindnesses to david your servant 
now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of yahweh filled the house 
the priests could not enter into the house of yahweh because the glory of yahweh filled yahweh s house 
all the children of israel looked on when the fire came down and the glory of yahweh was on the house and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and gave thanks to yahweh saying for he is good for his loving kindness endures for ever 
then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before yahweh 
king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the people dedicated god s house 
the priests stood according to their positions the levites also with instruments of music of yahweh which david the king had made to give thanks to yahweh when david praised by their ministry saying for his loving kindness endures for ever the priests sounded trumpets before them and all israel stood 
moreover solomon made the middle of the court holy that was before the house of yahweh for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar which solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering and the meal offering and the fat 
so solomon held the feast at that time seven days and all israel with him a very great assembly from the entrance of hamath to the brook of egypt 
on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days 
on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that yahweh had shown to david and to solomon and to israel his people 
thus solomon finished the house of yahweh and the king s house and he successfully completed all that came into solomon s heart to make in the house of yahweh and in his own house 
yahweh appeared to solomon by night and said to him i have heard your prayer and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice 
 if i shut up the sky so that there is no rain or if i command the locust to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people 
if my people who are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land 
now my eyes shall be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place 
for now have i chosen and made this house holy that my name may be there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually 
 as for you if you will walk before me as david your father walked and do according to all that i have commanded you and will keep my statutes and my ordinances 
then i will establish the throne of your kingdom according as i covenanted with david your father saying there shall not fail you a man to be ruler in israel 
but if you turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them 
then i will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have made holy for my name i will cast out of my sight and i will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples 
this house which is so high everyone who passes by it shall be astonished and shall say why has yahweh done thus to this land and to this house ? 
they shall answer because they abandoned yahweh the god of their fathers who brought them forth out of the land of egypt and took other gods worshiped them and served them therefore he has brought all this evil on them 
it happened at the end of twenty years in which solomon had built the house of yahweh and his own house 
that the cities which huram had given to solomon solomon built them and caused the children of israel to dwell there 
solomon went to hamath zobah and prevailed against it 
he built tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities which he built in hamath 
also he built beth horon the upper and beth horon the lower fortified cities with walls gates and bars 
and baalath and all the storage cities that solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen and all that solomon desired to build for his pleasure in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion 
but of the children of israel solomon made no servants for his work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen 
these were the chief officers of king solomon even two hundred fifty who ruled over the people 
solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of david to the house that he had built for her for he said my wife shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel because the places where the ark of yahweh has come are holy 
then solomon offered burnt offerings to yahweh on the altar of yahweh which he had built before the porch 
even as the duty of every day required offering according to the commandment of moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the set feasts three times in the year in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tents 
he appointed according to the ordinance of david his father the divisions of the priests to their service and the levites to their offices to praise and to minister before the priests as the duty of every day required the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate for so had david the man of god commanded 
they didn t depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasures 
now all the work of solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of yahweh and until it was finished so the house of yahweh was completed 
then went solomon to ezion geber and to eloth on the seashore in the land of edom 
huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants and they came with the servants of solomon to ophir and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold and brought them to king solomon 
when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great train and camels that bore spices and gold in abundance and precious stones and when she had come to solomon she talked with him of all that was in her heart 
solomon told her all her questions and there was not anything hidden from solomon which he didn t tell her 
when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built 
and the food of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their clothing his cup bearers also and their clothing and his ascent by which he went up to the house of yahweh there was no more spirit in her 
she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom 
however i didn t believe their words until i came and my eyes had seen it and behold the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me you exceed the fame that i heard 
happy are your men and happy are these your servants who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom 
blessed be yahweh your god who delighted in you to set you on his throne to be king for yahweh your god because your god loved israel to establish them forever therefore made he you king over them to do justice and righteousness 
the servants also of huram and the servants of solomon who brought gold from ophir brought algum trees and precious stones 
the king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of yahweh and for the king s house and harps and stringed instruments for the singers and there were none like these seen before in the land of judah 
king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatever she asked besides that which she had brought to the king so she turned and went to her own land she and her servants 
now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty six talents of gold 
besides that which the traders and merchants brought and all the kings of arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon 
king solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler 
he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon 
moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold 
and there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold which were fastened to the throne and stays on either side by the place of the seat and two lions standing beside the stays 
twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps there was nothing like it made in any kingdom 
all king solomon s drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold silver was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon 
for the king had ships that went to tarshish with the servants of huram once every three years came the ships of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks 
so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom 
all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart 
they brought every man his tribute vessels of silver and vessels of gold and clothing armor and spices horses and mules a rate year by year 
solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem 
he ruled over all the kings from the river even to the land of the philistines and to the border of egypt 
the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland for abundance 
they brought horses for solomon out of egypt and out of all lands 
now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last aren t they written in the history of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite and in the visions of iddo the seer concerning jeroboam the son of nebat ?
solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years 
solomon slept with his fathers and he was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his place 
rehoboam went to shechem for all israel had come to shechem to make him king 
it happened when jeroboam the son of nebat heard of it for he was in egypt where he had fled from the presence of king solomon that jeroboam returned out of egypt 
they sent and called him and jeroboam and all israel came and they spoke to rehoboam saying 
 your father made our yoke grievous now therefore make you the grievous service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us lighter and we will serve you 
he said to them come again to me after three days the people departed 
king rehoboam took counsel with the old men who had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? 
they spoke to him saying if you are kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them then they will be your servants forever 
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him who stood before him 
he said to them what counsel do you give that we may return answer to this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? 
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him saying thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you saying your father made our yoke heavy but make it lighter on us thus you shall say to them my little finger is thicker than my father s waist 
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions 
so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king asked saying come to me again the third day 
the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men 
and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add to it my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions 
so the king didn t listen to the people for it was brought about of god that yahweh might establish his word which he spoke by ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat 
when all israel saw that the king didn t listen to them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david ? neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse ! every man to your tents israel ! now see to your own house david so all israel departed to their tents 
but as for the children of israel who lived in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them 
then king rehoboam sent hadoram who was over the men subject to forced labor and the children of israel stoned him to death with stones king rehoboam made speed to get himself up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem 
so israel rebelled against the house of david to this day 
when rehoboam had come to jerusalem he assembled the house of judah and benjamin one hundred eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors to fight against israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam 
but the word of yahweh came to shemaiah the man of god saying 
 speak to rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin saying 
 thus says yahweh you shall not go up nor fight against your brothers ! return every man to his house for this thing is of me so they listened to the words of yahweh and returned from going against jeroboam 
rehoboam lived in jerusalem and built cities for defense in judah 
he built bethlehem and etam and tekoa 
beth zur and soco and adullam 
and gath and mareshah and ziph 
and adoraim and lachish and azekah 
and zorah and aijalon and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fortified cities 
he fortified the strongholds and put captains in them and stores of food and oil and wine 
he put shields and spears in every city and made them exceeding strong judah and benjamin belonged to him 
the priests and the levites who were in all israel resorted to him out of all their border 
for the levites left their suburbs and their possession and came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons cast them off that they should not execute the priest s office to yahweh 
and he appointed him priests for the high places and for the male goats and for the calves which he had made 
after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their hearts to seek yahweh the god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrifice to yahweh the god of their fathers 
so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong three years for they walked three years in the way of david and solomon 
rehoboam took him a wife mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david and of abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse 
and she bore him sons jeush and shemariah and zaham 
after her he took maacah the daughter of absalom and she bore him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith 
rehoboam loved maacah the daughter of absalom above all his wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines and became the father of twenty eight sons and sixty daughters 
rehoboam appointed abijah the son of maacah to be chief the prince among his brothers for he intended to make him king 
he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of judah and benjamin to every fortified city and he gave them food in abundance he sought for them many wives 
it happened when the kingdom of rehoboam was established and he was strong that he forsook the law of yahweh and all israel with him 
it happened in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they had trespassed against yahweh 
with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen the people were without number who came with him out of egypt the lubim the sukkiim and the ethiopians 
he took the fortified cities which pertained to judah and came to jerusalem 
now shemaiah the prophet came to rehoboam and to the princes of judah who were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak and said to them thus says yahweh you have forsaken me therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak 
then the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves and they said yahweh is righteous 
when yahweh saw that they humbled themselves the word of yahweh came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselves i will not destroy them but i will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out on jerusalem by the hand of shishak 
nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries 
so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of yahweh and the treasures of the king s house he took it all away he also took away the shields of gold which solomon had made 
king rehoboam made in their place shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who kept the door of the king s house 
it was so that as often as the king entered into the house of yahweh the guard came and bore them and brought them back into the guard room 
when he humbled himself the wrath of yahweh turned from him so as not to destroy him altogether and moreover in judah there were good things found 
so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reigned for rehoboam was forty one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mother s name was naamah the ammonitess 
he did that which was evil because he didn t set his heart to seek yahweh 
now the acts of rehoboam first and last aren t they written in the histories of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer after the way of genealogies ? there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam continually 
rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and abijah his son reigned in his place 
in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah 
he reigned three years in jerusalem and his mother s name was micaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah there was war between abijah and jeroboam 
abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war even four hundred thousand chosen men and jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men who were mighty men of valor 
abijah stood up on mount zemaraim which is in the hill country of ephraim and said hear me jeroboam and all israel 
ought you not to know that yahweh the god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david forever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt ?
yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david rose up and rebelled against his lord 
there were gathered to him worthless men base fellows who strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them 
 now you think to withstand the kingdom of yahweh in the hand of the sons of david and you are a great multitude and there are with you the golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods 
haven t you driven out the priests of yahweh the sons of aaron and the levites and made priests for yourselves after the ways of the peoples of other lands ? so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams the same may be a priest of those who are no gods 
 but as for us yahweh is our god and we have not forsaken him and we have priests ministering to yahweh the sons of aaron and the levites in their work 
and they burn to yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense they also set the show bread in order on the pure table and the lampstand of gold with its lamps to burn every evening for we keep the instruction of yahweh our god but you have forsaken him 
behold god is with us at our head and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you children of israel don t fight against yahweh the god of your fathers for you shall not prosper 
but jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them so they were before judah and the ambush was behind them 
when judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind them and they cried to yahweh and the priests sounded with the trumpets 
then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah shouted it happened that god struck jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah 
the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered them into their hand 
abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men 
thus the children of israel were brought under at that time and the children of judah prevailed because they relied on yahweh the god of their fathers 
abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him bethel with its towns and jeshanah with its towns and ephron with its towns 
jeroboam didn t recover strength again in the days of abijah yahweh struck him and he died 
but abijah grew mighty and took to himself fourteen wives and became the father of twenty two sons and sixteen daughters 
the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet iddo 
so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his place in his days the land was quiet ten years 
asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of yahweh his god 
for he took away the foreign altars and the high places and broke down the pillars and cut down the asherim 
and commanded judah to seek yahweh the god of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment 
also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the sun images and the kingdom was quiet before him 
he built fortified cities in judah for the land was quiet and he had no war in those years because yahweh had given him rest 
for he said to judah let us build these cities and make walls around them with towers gates and bars the land is yet before us because we have sought yahweh our god we have sought him and he has given us rest on every side so they built and prospered 
asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears out of judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bore shields and drew bows two hundred eighty thousand all these were mighty men of valor 
there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an army of a million troops and three hundred chariots and he came to mareshah 
then asa went out to meet him and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah 
asa cried to yahweh his god and said yahweh there is none besides you to help between the mighty and him who has no strength help us yahweh our god for we rely on you and in your name are we come against this multitude yahweh you are our god don t let man prevail against you 
so yahweh struck the ethiopians before asa and before judah and the ethiopians fled 
asa and the people who were with him pursued them to gerar and there fell of the ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves for they were destroyed before yahweh and before his army and they carried away very much booty 
they struck all the cities around gerar for the fear of yahweh came on them and they despoiled all the cities for there was much spoil in them 
they struck also the tents of livestock and carried away sheep in abundance and camels and returned to jerusalem 
the spirit of god came on azariah the son of oded 
and he went out to meet asa and said to him hear me asa and all judah and benjamin ! yahweh is with you while you are with him and if you seek him he will be found by you but if you forsake him he will forsake you 
now for a long time israel was without the true god and without a teaching priest and without law 
but when in their distress they turned to yahweh the god of israel and sought him he was found by them 
in those times there was no peace to him who went out nor to him who came in but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands 
they were broken in pieces nation against nation and city against city for god troubled them with all adversity 
but you be strong and don t let your hands be slack for your work shall be rewarded 
when asa heard these words and the prophecy of oded the prophet he took courage and put away the abominations out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of ephraim and he renewed the altar of yahweh that was before the porch of yahweh 
he gathered all judah and benjamin and those who lived with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that yahweh his god was with him 
so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa 
they sacrificed to yahweh in that day of the spoil which they had brought seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep 
they entered into the covenant to seek yahweh the god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul 
and that whoever would not seek yahweh the god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman 
they swore to yahweh with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with cornets 
all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and yahweh gave them rest all around 
also maacah the mother of asa the king he removed from being queen because she had made an abominable image for an asherah and asa cut down her image and made dust of it and burnt it at the brook kidron 
but the high places were not taken away out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days 
he brought into god s house the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold and vessels 
there was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa 
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to asa king of judah 
then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of yahweh and of the king s house and sent to ben hadad king of syria who lived at damascus saying 
 let there be a treaty between me and you as there was between my father and your father behold i have sent you silver and gold go break your treaty with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me 
ben hadad listened to king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and they struck ijon and dan and abel maim and all the storage cities of naphtali 
it happened when baasha heard of it that he left off building ramah and let his work cease 
then asa the king took all judah and they carried away the stones of ramah and its timber with which baasha had built and he built therewith geba and mizpah 
at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said to him because you have relied on the king of syria and have not relied on yahweh your god therefore is the army of the king of syria escaped out of your hand 
weren t the ethiopians and the lubim a huge army with chariots and horsemen exceeding many ? yet because you relied on yahweh he delivered them into your hand 
for the eyes of yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him herein you have done foolishly for from henceforth you shall have wars 
then asa was angry with the seer and put him in the prison for he was in a rage with him because of this thing asa oppressed some of the people at the same time 
behold the acts of asa first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel 
in the thirty ninth year of his reign asa was diseased in his feet his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he didn t seek yahweh but to the physicians 
asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign 
they buried him in his own tombs which he had dug out for himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers art and they made a very great burning for him 
jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place and strengthened himself against israel 
he placed forces in all the fortified cities of judah and set garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim which asa his father had taken 
yahweh was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father david and didn t seek the baals 
but sought to the god of his father and walked in his commandments and not after the doings of israel 
therefore yahweh established the kingdom in his hand and all judah brought to jehoshaphat tribute and he had riches and honor in abundance 
his heart was lifted up in the ways of yahweh and furthermore he took away the high places and the asherim out of judah 
also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes even ben hail and obadiah and zechariah and nethanel and micaiah to teach in the cities of judah 
and with them the levites even shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tobadonijah the levites and with them elishama and jehoram the priests 
they taught in judah having the book of the law of yahweh with them and they went about throughout all the cities of judah and taught among the people 
the fear of yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around judah so that they made no war against jehoshaphat 
some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute the arabians also brought him flocks seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats 
jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly and he built in judah castles and cities of store 
he had many works in the cities of judah and men of war mighty men of valor in jerusalem 
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers houses of judah the captains of thousands adnah the captain and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand 
and next to him jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred eighty thousand 
and next to him amasiah the son of zichri who willingly offered himself to yahweh and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor 
of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valor and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield 
and next to him jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready prepared for war 
these were those who waited on the king besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all judah 
now jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance and he joined affinity with ahab 
after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance and for the people who were with him and moved him to go up with him to ramoth gilead 
ahab king of israel said to jehoshaphat king of judah will you go with me to ramoth gilead ? he answered him i am as you are and my people as your people we will be with you in the war 
jehoshaphat said to the king of israel please inquire first for the word of yahweh 
then the king of israel gathered the prophets together four hundred men and said to them shall we go to ramoth gilead to battle or shall i forbear ? they said go up for god will deliver it into the hand of the king 
but jehoshaphat said isn t there here a prophet of yahweh besides that we may inquire of him ? 
the king of israel said to jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of yahweh but i hate him for he never prophesies good concerning me but always evil he is micaiah the son of imla jehoshaphat said don t let the king say so 
then the king of israel called an officer and said get micaiah the son of imla quickly 
now the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne arrayed in their robes and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets were prophesying before them 
zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and said thus says yahweh with these you shall push the syrians until they are consumed 
all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramoth gilead and prosper for yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king 
the messenger who went to call micaiah spoke to him saying behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth let your word therefore please be like one of theirs and speak good 
micaiah said as yahweh lives what my god says that will i speak 
when he had come to the king the king said to him micaiah shall we go to ramoth gilead to battle or shall i forbear ? he said go up and prosper they shall be delivered into your hand 
the king said to him how many times shall i adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of yahweh ? 
he said i saw all israel scattered on the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd yahweh said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace 
the king of israel said to jehoshaphat didn t i tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me but evil ? 
micaiah said therefore hear the word of yahweh i saw yahweh sitting on his throne and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left 
yahweh said who shall entice ahab king of israel that he may go up and fall at ramoth gilead ? one spoke saying in this way and another saying in that way 
a spirit came out stood before yahweh and said i will entice him yahweh said to him how ? 
 he said i will go forth and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets he said you will entice him and will prevail also go forth and do so 
 now therefore behold yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets and yahweh has spoken evil concerning you 
then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and struck micaiah on the cheek and said which way did the spirit of yahweh go from me to speak to you ? 
micaiah said behold you shall see on that day when you shall go into an inner room to hide yourself 
the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back to amon the governor of the city and to joash the king s son 
and say thus says the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i return in peace 
micaiah said if you return at all in peace yahweh has not spoken by me he said listen you peoples all of you ! 
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramoth gilead 
the king of israel said to jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and go into the battle but you put on your robes so the king of israel disguised himself and they went into the battle 
now the king of syria had commanded the captains of his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great except only with the king of israel 
it happened when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel ! therefore they turned around to fight against him but jehoshaphat cried out and yahweh helped him and god moved them to depart from him 
it happened when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him 
a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of israel between the joints of the armor therefore he said to the driver of the chariot turn your hand and carry me out of the army for i am severely wounded 
the battle increased that day however the king of israel propped himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the evening and about the time of the going down of the sun he died 
jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace to jerusalem 
jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to king jehoshaphat should you help the wicked and love those who hate yahweh ? because of this wrath is on you from before yahweh 
nevertheless there are good things found in you in that you have put away the asheroth out of the land and have set your heart to seek god 
jehoshaphat lived at jerusalem and he went out again among the people from beersheba to the hill country of ephraim and brought them back to yahweh the god of their fathers 
he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of judah city by city 
and said to the judges consider what you do for you don t judge for man but for yahweh and he is with you in the judgment 
now therefore let the fear of yahweh be on you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with yahweh our god nor respect of persons nor taking of bribes 
moreover in jerusalem jehoshaphat appointed levites and priests and of the heads of the fathers households of israel for the judgment of yahweh and for controversies they returned to jerusalem 
he commanded them saying thus you shall do in the fear of yahweh faithfully and with a perfect heart 
whenever any controversy shall come to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities between blood and blood between law and commandment statutes and ordinances you shall warn them that they not be guilty towards yahweh and so wrath come on you and on your brothers do this and you shall not be guilty 
behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of yahweh and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the house of judah in all the king s matters also the levites shall be officers before you deal courageously and may yahweh be with the good 
it happened after this that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them some of the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle 
then some came who told jehoshaphat saying a great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from syria behold they are in hazazon tamar that is en gedi 
jehoshaphat was alarmed and set himself to seek to yahweh he proclaimed a fast throughout all judah 
judah gathered themselves together to seek help from yahweh they came out of all the cities of judah to seek yahweh 
jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of judah and jerusalem in the house of yahweh before the new court 
and he said yahweh the god of our fathers aren t you god in heaven ? aren t you ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations ? power and might are in your hand so that no one is able to withstand you 
didn t you our god drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people israel and give it to the seed of abraham your friend forever ?
they lived in it and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name saying 
 if evil comes on us the sword judgment pestilence or famine we will stand before this house and before you for your name is in this house and cry to you in our affliction and you will hear and save 
now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir whom you would not let israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned aside from them and didn t destroy them 
behold how they reward us to come to cast us out of your possession which you have given us to inherit 
our god will you not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are on you 
all judah stood before yahweh with their little ones their wives and their children 
then the spirit of yahweh came on jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the son of jeiel the son of mattaniah the levite of the sons of asaph in the midst of the assembly 
and he said listen all judah and you inhabitants of jerusalem and you king jehoshaphat thus says yahweh to you don t be afraid neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but god s 
tomorrow go down against them behold they are coming up by the ascent of ziz you shall find them at the end of the valley before the wilderness of jeruel 
you will not need to fight this battle set yourselves stand still and see the salvation of yahweh with you o judah and jerusalem don t be afraid nor be dismayed go out against them tomorrow for yahweh is with you 
jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell down before yahweh worshipping yahweh 
the levites of the children of the kohathites and of the children of the korahites stood up to praise yahweh the god of israel with an exceeding loud voice 
they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said listen to me judah and you inhabitants of jerusalem ! believe in yahweh your god so you shall be established ! believe his prophets so you shall prosper 
when he had taken counsel with the people he appointed those who should sing to yahweh and give praise in holy array as they went out before the army and say give thanks to yahweh for his loving kindness endures forever 
when they began to sing and to praise yahweh set ambushers against the children of ammon moab and mount seir who had come against judah and they were struck 
for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir utterly to kill and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir everyone helped to destroy another 
when judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness they looked at the multitude and behold they were dead bodies fallen to the earth and there were none who escaped 
when jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in taking the spoil it was so much 
on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of beracah for there they blessed yahweh therefore the name of that place was called the valley of beracah to this day 
then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in their forefront to go again to jerusalem with joy for yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies 
they came to jerusalem with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets to the house of yahweh 
the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that yahweh fought against the enemies of israel 
so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him rest all around 
jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty five years in jerusalem and his mother s name was azubah the daughter of shilhi 
he walked in the way of asa his father and didn t turn aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of yahweh 
however the high places were not taken away neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the god of their fathers 
now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last behold they are written in the history of jehu the son of hanani which is inserted in the book of the kings of israel 
after this jehoshaphat king of judah joined himself with ahaziah king of israel the same did very wickedly 
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish and they made the ships in ezion geber 
then eliezer the son of dodavahu of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat saying because you have joined yourself with ahaziah yahweh has destroyed your works the ships were broken so that they were not able to go to tarshish 
jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and jehoram his son reigned in his place 
he had brothers the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel 
their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fortified cities in judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn 
now when jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father and had strengthened himself he killed all his brothers with the sword and various also of the princes of israel 
jehoram was thirty two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem 
he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab as wife and he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh 
however yahweh would not destroy the house of david because of the covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always 
in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made a king over themselves 
then jehoram passed over with his captains and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and struck the edomites who surrounded him along with the captains of the chariots 
so edom revolted from under the hand of judah to this day then libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand because he had forsaken yahweh the god of his fathers 
moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah and made the inhabitants of jerusalem to play the prostitute and led judah astray 
a letter came to him from elijah the prophet saying thus says yahweh the god of david your father because you have not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat your father nor in the ways of asa king of judah 
but have walked in the way of the kings of israel and have made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to play the prostitute like the house of ahab did and also have slain your brothers of your father s house who were better than yourself 
behold yahweh will strike with a great plague your people and your children and your wives and all your substance 
and you shall have great sickness by disease of your bowels until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day 
yahweh stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines and of the arabians who are beside the ethiopians 
and they came up against judah and broke into it and carried away all the substance that was found in the king s house and his sons also and his wives so that there was never a son left him except jehoahaz the youngest of his sons 
after all this yahweh struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease 
it happened in process of time at the end of two years that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness and he died of severe diseases his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers 
thirty two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem eight years and he departed without being desired and they buried him in the city of david but not in the tombs of the kings 
the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his place for the band of men who came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned 
forty two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem and his mother s name was athaliah the daughter of omri 
he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh as did the house of ahab for they were his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction 
he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramoth gilead and the syrians wounded joram 
he returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at ramah when he fought against hazael king of syria azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was sick 
now the destruction of ahaziah was of god in that he went to joram for when he had come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom yahweh had anointed to cut off the house of ahab 
it happened when jehu was executing judgment on the house of ahab that he found the princes of judah and the sons of the brothers of ahaziah ministering to ahaziah and killed them 
he sought ahaziah and they caught him now he was hiding in samaria and they brought him to jehu and killed him and they buried him for they said he is the son of jehoshaphat who sought yahweh with all his heart the house of ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom 
now when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of judah 
but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him away from among the king s sons who were slain and put him and his nurse in the bedroom so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she was the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she didn t kill him 
he was with them hidden in god s house six years and athaliah reigned over the land 
in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him 
they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah and the heads of fathers households of israel and they came to jerusalem 
all the assembly made a covenant with the king in god s house he said to them behold the king s son shall reign as yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of david 
this is the thing that you shall do a third part of you who come in on the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters of the thresholds 
a third part shall be at the king s house and a third part at the gate of the foundation all the people shall be in the courts of yahweh s house 
but let no one come into the house of yahweh except the priests and those who minister of the levites they shall come in for they are holy but all the people shall follow yahweh s instructions 
the levites shall surround the king every man with his weapons in his hand whoever comes into the house let him be slain be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out 
so the levites and all judah did according to all that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men those who were to come in on the sabbath with those who were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada the priest didn t dismiss the shift 
jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears and bucklers and shields that had been king david s which were in god s house 
he set all the people every man with his weapon in his hand from the right side of the house to the left side of the house along by the altar and the house around the king 
then they brought out the king s son and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony and made him king and jehoiada and his sons anointed him and they said long live the king ! 
when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people into the house of yahweh 
and she looked and behold the king stood by his pillar at the entrance and the captains and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets the singers also played musical instruments and led the singing of praise then athaliah tore her clothes and said treason ! treason ! 
jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army and said to them bring her out between the ranks and whoever follows her let him be slain with the sword for the priest said don t kill her in the yahweh s house 
so they made way for her she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king s house and they killed her there 
jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be yahweh s people 
all the people went to the house of baal and broke it down and broke his altars and his images in pieces and killed mattan the priest of baal before the altars 
jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of yahweh under the hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in the house of yahweh to offer the burnt offerings of yahweh as it is written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing according to the order of david 
he set the porters at the gates of the house of yahweh that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in 
he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of yahweh and they came through the upper gate to the king s house and set the king on the throne of the kingdom 
so all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet athaliah they had slain with the sword 
joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem and his mother s name was zibiah of beersheba 
joash did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh all the days of jehoiada the priest 
jehoiada took for him two wives and he became the father of sons and daughters 
it happened after this that joash intended to restore the house of yahweh 
he gathered together the priests and the levites and said to them go out to the cities of judah and gather money to repair the house of your god from all israel from year to year see that you expedite this matter however the levites didn t do it right away 
the king called for jehoiada the chief and said to him why haven t you required of the levites to bring in the tax of moses the servant of yahweh and of the assembly of israel out of judah and out of jerusalem for the tent of the testimony ? 
for the sons of athaliah that wicked woman had broken up god s house and they also gave all the dedicated things of the house of yahweh to the baals 
so the king commanded and they made a chest and set it outside at the gate of the house of yahweh 
they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to bring in for yahweh the tax that moses the servant of god laid on israel in the wilderness 
all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end 
it was so that whenever the chest was brought to the king s officers by the hand of the levites and when they saw that there was much money the king s scribe and the chief priest s officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to its place again thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance 
the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of yahweh and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of yahweh and also such as worked iron and brass to repair the house of yahweh 
so the workmen worked and the work of repairing went forward in their hands and they set up god s house in its state and strengthened it 
when they had made an end they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada of which were made vessels for the house of yahweh even vessels with which to minister and to offer and spoons and vessels of gold and silver they offered burnt offerings in the house of yahweh continually all the days of jehoiada 
but jehoiada grew old and was full of days and he died one hundred thirty years old was he when he died 
they buried him in the city of david among the kings because he had done good in israel and toward god and his house 
now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah and made obeisance to the king then the king listened to them 
they forsook the house of yahweh the god of their fathers and served the asherim and the idols and wrath came on judah and jerusalem for this their guiltiness 
yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again to yahweh and they testified against them but they would not give ear 
the spirit of god came on zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest and he stood above the people and said to them thus says god why do you disobey the commandments of yahweh so that you can t prosper ? because you have forsaken yahweh he has also forsaken you 
they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of yahweh 
thus joash the king didn t remember the kindness which jehoiada his father had done to him but killed his son when he died he said may yahweh look at it and repay it 
it happened at the end of the year that the army of the syrians came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of damascus 
for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men and yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand because they had forsaken yahweh the god of their fathers so they executed judgment on joash 
when they were departed for him for they left him very sick his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of jehoiada the priest and killed him on his bed and he died and they buried him in the city of david but they didn t bury him in the tombs of the kings 
these are those who conspired against him zabad the son of shimeath the ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith the moabitess 
now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid on him and the rebuilding of god s house behold they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings amaziah his son reigned in his place 
amaziah was twenty five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty nine years in jerusalem and his mother s name was jehoaddan of jerusalem 
he did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh but not with a perfect heart 
now it happened when the kingdom was established to him that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father 
but he didn t put their children to death but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of moses as yahweh commanded saying the fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin 
moreover amaziah gathered judah together and ordered them according to their fathers houses under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds even all judah and benjamin and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward and found them three hundred thousand chosen men able to go forth to war who could handle spear and shield 
he hired also one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of israel for one hundred talents of silver 
a man of god came to him saying o king don t let the army of israel go with you for yahweh is not with israel with all the children of ephraim 
but if you will go take action be strong for the battle god will overthrow you before the enemy for god has power to help and to overthrow 
amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel ? the man of god answered yahweh is able to give you much more than this 
then amaziah separated them the army that had come to him out of ephraim to go home again therefore their anger was greatly kindled against judah and they returned home in fierce anger 
amaziah took courage and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and struck ten thousand of the children of seir 
the children of judah carry away ten thousand alive and brought them to the top of the rock and threw them down from the top of the rock so that they all were broken in pieces 
but the men of the army whom amaziah sent back that they should not go with him to battle fell on the cities of judah from samaria even to beth horon and struck of them three thousand and took much spoil 
now it happened after that amaziah had come from the slaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children of seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before them and burned incense to them 
therefore the anger of yahweh was kindled against amaziah and he sent to him a prophet who said to him why have you sought after the gods of the people which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? 
it happened as he talked with him that the king said to him have we made you one of the king s counselors ? stop ! why should you be struck down ? then the prophet stopped and said i know that god has determined to destroy you because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel 
then amaziah king of judah consulted his advisers and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us look one another in the face 
joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give your daughter to my son as his wife then a wild animal that was in lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle 
you say to yourself that you have struck edom and your heart lifts you up to boast now stay at home why should you meddle with trouble that you should fall even you and judah with you ? 
but amaziah would not listen for it was of god that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they had sought after the gods of edom 
so joash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at beth shemesh which belongs to judah 
judah was defeated by israel and they fled every man to his tent 
joash king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz at beth shemesh and brought him to jerusalem and broke down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubits 
he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in god s house with obed edom and the treasures of the king s house the hostages also and returned to samaria 
amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years 
now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last behold aren t they written in the book of the kings of judah and israel ?
now from the time that amaziah turned away from following yahweh they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem he fled to lachish but they sent after him to lachish and killed him there 
they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of judah 
all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in the place of his father amaziah 
he built eloth and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers 
sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign and he reigned fifty two years in jerusalem and his mother s name was jechiliah of jerusalem 
he did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh according to all that his father amaziah had done 
he set himself to seek god in the days of zechariah who had understanding in the vision of god and as long as he sought yahweh god made him to prosper 
he went forth and warred against the philistines and broke down the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdod and he built cities in the country of ashdod and among the philistines 
god helped him against the philistines and against the arabians who lived in gur baal and the meunim 
the ammonites gave tribute to uzziah and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of egypt for he grew exceeding strong 
moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified them 
he built towers in the wilderness and dug out many cisterns for he had much livestock in the lowland also and in the plain and he had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields for he loved farming 
moreover uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by bands according to the number of their reckoning made by jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the officer under the hand of hananiah one of the king s captains 
the whole number of the heads of fathers households even the mighty men of valor was two thousand and six hundred 
under their hand was an army three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred who made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy 
uzziah prepared for them even for all the army shields and spears and helmets and coats of mail and bows and stones for slinging 
he made in jerusalem engines invented by skillful men to be on the towers and on the battlements with which to shoot arrows and great stones his name spread far abroad for he was marvelously helped until he was strong 
but when he was strong his heart was lifted up so that he did corruptly and he trespassed against yahweh his god for he went into yahweh s temple to burn incense on the altar of incense 
azariah the priest went in after him and with him eighty priests of yahweh who were valiant men 
and they resisted uzziah the king and said to him it isn t for you uzziah to burn incense to yahweh but for the priests the sons of aaron who are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for you have trespassed neither shall it be for your honor from yahweh god 
then uzziah was angry and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense and while he was angry with the priests the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of yahweh beside the altar of incense 
azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked on him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out quickly from there yes himself hurried also to go out because yahweh had struck him 
uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death and lived in a separate house being a leper for he was cut off from the house of yahweh and jotham his son was over the king s house judging the people of the land 
now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last isaiah the prophet the son of amoz wrote 
so uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings for they said he is a leper jotham his son reigned in his place 
jotham was twenty five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and his mother s name was jerushah the daughter of zadok 
he did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh according to all that his father uzziah had done however he didn t enter into yahweh s temple the people still did corruptly 
he built the upper gate of the house of yahweh and on the wall of ophel he built much 
moreover he built cities in the hill country of judah and in the forests he built castles and towers 
he fought also with the king of the children of ammon and prevailed against them the children of ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand of barley the children of ammon gave that much to him in the second year also and in the third 
so jotham became mighty because he ordered his ways before yahweh his god 
now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and his ways behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah 
he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem 
jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and ahaz his son reigned in his place 
ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and he didn t do that which was right in the eyes of yahweh like david his father 
but he walked in the ways of the kings of israel and made also molten images for the baals 
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom and burnt his children in the fire according to the abominations of the nations whom yahweh cast out before the children of israel 
he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree 
zichri a mighty man of ephraim killed maaseiah the king s son and azrikam the ruler of the house and elkanah who was next to the king 
the children of israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria 
but a prophet of yahweh was there whose name was oded and he went out to meet the army that came to samaria and said to them behold because yahweh the god of your fathers was angry with judah he has delivered them into your hand and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven 
now you purpose to keep under the children of judah and jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids for yourselves aren t there even with you trespasses of your own against yahweh your god ?
now hear me therefore and send back the captives that you have taken captive from your brothers for the fierce wrath of yahweh is on you 
then some of the heads of the children of ephraim azariah the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against those who came from the war 
and said to them you shall not bring in the captives here for you purpose that which will bring on us a trespass against yahweh to add to our sins and to our trespass for our trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against israel 
so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly 
the men who have been mentioned by name rose up and took the captives 
and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them dressed them 
gave them sandals 
and gave them something to eat and to drink 
anointed them 
carried all the feeble of them on donkeys and brought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brothers 
then they returned to samaria 
the philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the south of judah and had taken beth shemesh and aijalon and gederoth and soco with its towns and timnah with its towns gimzo also and its towns and they lived there 
for yahweh brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel for he had dealt wantonly in judah and trespassed severely against yahweh 
tilgath pilneser king of assyria came to him and distressed him but didn t strengthen him 
for ahaz took away a portion out of the house of yahweh and out of the house of the king and of the princes and gave it to the king of assyria but it didn t help him 
in the time of his distress he trespassed yet more against yahweh this same king ahaz 
for he sacrificed to the gods of damascus which struck him and he said because the gods of the kings of syria helped them so i will sacrifice to them that they may help me but they were the ruin of him and of all israel 
ahaz gathered together the vessels of god s house and cut in pieces the vessels of god s house and shut up the doors of the house of yahweh and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem 
in every city of judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods and provoked to anger yahweh the god of his fathers 
now the rest of his acts and all his ways first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel 
ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in jerusalem for they didn t bring him into the tombs of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his place 
hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty five years old and he reigned twenty nine years in jerusalem and his mother s name was abijah the daughter of zechariah 
he did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh according to all that david his father had done 
he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the doors of the house of yahweh and repaired them 
for our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in the sight of yahweh our god and have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of yahweh and turned their backs 
also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the god of israel 
therefore the wrath of yahweh was on judah and jerusalem and he has delivered them to be tossed back and forth to be an astonishment and a hissing as you see with your eyes 
for behold our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this 
now it is in my heart to make a covenant with yahweh the god of israel that his fierce anger may turn away from us 
my sons don t be negligent now for yahweh has chosen you to stand before him to minister to him and that you should be his ministers and burn incense 
they gathered their brothers and sanctified themselves and went in according to the commandment of the king by the words of yahweh to cleanse the house of yahweh 
the priests went in to the inner part of the house of yahweh to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in yahweh s temple into the court of the house of yahweh the levites took it to carry it out abroad to the brook kidron 
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of yahweh and they sanctified the house of yahweh in eight days and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end 
then they went in to hezekiah the king within the palace and said we have cleansed all the house of yahweh and the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels and the table of show bread with all its vessels 
moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign threw away when he trespassed have we prepared and sanctified and behold they are before the altar of yahweh 
then hezekiah the king arose early and gathered the princes of the city and went up to the house of yahweh 
they brought seven bulls and seven rams and seven lambs and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for judah he commanded the priests the sons of aaron to offer them on the altar of yahweh 
so they killed the bulls and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar and they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar they killed also the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar 
he set the levites in the house of yahweh with cymbals with stringed instruments and with harps according to the commandment of david and of gad the king s seer and nathan the prophet for the commandment was of yahweh by his prophets 
the levites stood with the instruments of david and the priests with the trumpets 
hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar when the burnt offering began the song of yahweh began also and the trumpets together with the instruments of david king of israel 
all the assembly worshiped and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded all this continued until the burnt offering was finished 
when they had made an end of offering the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped 
moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites to sing praises to yahweh with the words of david and of asaph the seer they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshiped 
then hezekiah answered now you have consecrated yourselves to yahweh come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of yahweh the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings 
the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls one hundred rams and two hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to yahweh 
the consecrated things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep 
but the priests were too few so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings therefore their brothers the levites helped them until the work was ended and until the priests had sanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests 
also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering so the service of the house of yahweh was set in order 
hezekiah rejoiced and all the people because of that which god had prepared for the people for the thing was done suddenly 
hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of yahweh at jerusalem to keep the passover to yahweh the god of israel 
for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the assembly in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month 
for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem 
the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly 
so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the passover to yahweh the god of israel at jerusalem for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written 
so the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of the king saying you children of israel turn again to yahweh the god of abraham isaac and israel that he may return to the remnant that have escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of assyria 
don t be like your fathers and like your brothers who trespassed against yahweh the god of their fathers so that he gave them up to desolation as you see 
now don t be stiff necked as your fathers were but yield yourselves to yahweh and enter into his sanctuary which he has sanctified forever and serve yahweh your god that his fierce anger may turn away from you 
for if you turn again to yahweh your brothers and your children shall find compassion before those who led them captive and shall come again into this land for yahweh your god is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if you return to him 
so the couriers passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even to zebulun but they ridiculed them and mocked them 
nevertheless certain men of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves and came to jerusalem 
also on judah came the hand of god to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of yahweh 
many people assembled at jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great assembly 
they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the brook kidron 
then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month and the priests and the levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of yahweh 
they stood in their place after their order according to the law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the levites 
for there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves therefore the levites were in charge of killing the passovers for everyone who was not clean to sanctify them to yahweh 
yahweh listened to hezekiah and healed the people 
the children of israel who were present at jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the levites and the priests praised yahweh day by day singing with loud instruments to yahweh 
hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the levites who had good understanding in the service of yahweh so they ate throughout the feast for the seven days offering sacrifices of peace offerings and making confession to yahweh the god of their fathers 
the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days and they kept another seven days with gladness 
for hezekiah king of judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests sanctified themselves 
all the assembly of judah with the priests and the levites and all the assembly who came out of israel and the foreigners who came out of the land of israel and who lived in judah rejoiced 
so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in jerusalem 
then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy habitation even to heaven 
now when all this was finished 
all israel who were present went out to the cities of judah 
and broke in pieces the pillars 
and cut down the asherim 
and broke down the high places and the altars out of all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had destroyed them all 
then all the children of israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities 
hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the levites after their divisions every man according to his service both the priests and the levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of yahweh 
he appointed also the king s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings for the morning and evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the set feasts as it is written in the law of yahweh 
moreover he commanded the people who lived in jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the levites that they might give themselves to the law of yahweh 
as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain new wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly 
the children of israel and judah who lived in the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to yahweh their god and laid them by heaps 
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and finished them in the seventh month 
when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they blessed yahweh and his people israel 
then hezekiah questioned the priests and the levites concerning the heaps 
azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him and said since people began to bring the offerings into the house of yahweh we have eaten and had enough and have left plenty for yahweh has blessed his people and that which is left is this great store 
then hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of yahweh and they prepared them 
they brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully and over them conaniah the levite was ruler and shimei his brother was second 
jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were overseers under the hand of conaniah and shimei his brother by the appointment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of god s house 
kore the son of imnah the levite the porter at the east gate was over the freewill offerings of god to distribute the offerings of yahweh and the most holy things 
under him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah amariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their office of trust to give to their brothers by divisions as well to the great as to the small 
besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males from three years old and upward even everyone who entered into the house of yahweh as the duty of every day required for their service in their offices according to their divisions 
and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers houses and the levites from twenty years old and upward in their offices by their divisions 
and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters through all the congregation for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness 
also for the sons of aaron the priests who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities in every city there were men who were mentioned by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the levites 
hezekiah did so throughout all judah and he worked that which was good and right and faithful before yahweh his god 
in every work that he began in the service of god s house and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he did it with all his heart and prospered 
after these things and this faithfulness sennacherib king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the fortified cities and thought to win them for himself 
when hezekiah saw that sennacherib had come and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem 
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city and they helped him 
so many people gathered together and they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water ? 
he took courage and built up all the wall that was broken down and raised it up to the towers and the other wall outside and strengthened millo in the city of david and made weapons and shields in abundance 
with him is an arm of flesh but with us is yahweh our god to help us and to fight our battles the people rested themselves on the words of hezekiah king of judah 
after this sennacherib king of assyria sent his servants to jerusalem now he was before lachish and all his power with him to hezekiah king of judah and to all judah who were at jerusalem saying 
thus says sennacherib king of assyria in whom do you trust that you remain under siege in jerusalem ?
doesn t hezekiah persuade you to give you over to die by famine and by thirst saying yahweh our god will deliver us out of the hand of the king of assyria ? 
hasn t the same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah and jerusalem saying you shall worship before one altar and on it you shall burn incense ? 
don t you know what i and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of my hand that your god should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
now therefore don t let hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you in this way neither believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand and out of the hand of my fathers how much less will your god deliver you out of my hand ? 
his servants spoke yet more against yahweh god and against his servant hezekiah 
he also wrote letters insulting yahweh the god of israel and to speak against him saying as the gods of the nations of the lands which have not delivered their people out of my hand so shall the god of hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand 
they cried with a loud voice in the jews language to the people of jerusalem who were on the wall to frighten them and to trouble them that they might take the city 
they spoke of the god of jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth which are the work of men s hands 
hezekiah the king and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz prayed because of this and cried to heaven 
yahweh sent an angel who cut off all the mighty men of valor and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of assyria so he returned with shame of face to his own land when he had come into the house of his god those who came forth from his own bowels killed him there with the sword 
thus yahweh saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of all others and guided them on every side 
many brought gifts to yahweh to jerusalem and precious things to hezekiah king of judah so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth 
in those days hezekiah was sick even to death and he prayed to yahweh and he spoke to him and gave him a sign 
but hezekiah didn t render again according to the benefit done to him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath on him and on judah and jerusalem 
notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath of yahweh didn t come on them in the days of hezekiah 
hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor and he provided him treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones and for spices and for shields and for all kinds of goodly vessels 
storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil and stalls for all kinds of animals and flocks in folds 
moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance for god had given him very much substance 
this same hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of gihon and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of david hezekiah prospered in all his works 
however concerning the ambassadors of the princes of babylon who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land god left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart 
now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his good deeds behold they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz in the book of the kings of judah and israel 
hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of david and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem did him honor at his death manasseh his son reigned in his place 
manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty five years in jerusalem 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh after the abominations of the nations whom yahweh cast out before the children of israel 
for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had broken down and he reared up altars for the baals and made asheroth and worshiped all the army of the sky and served them 
he built altars in the house of yahweh of which yahweh said my name shall be in jerusalem forever 
he built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of yahweh 
he also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom and he practiced sorcery and used enchantments and practiced sorcery and dealt with those who had familiar spirits and with wizards he worked much evil in the sight of yahweh to provoke him to anger 
he set the engraved image of the idol which he had made in god s house of which god said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel will i put my name forever 
neither will i any more remove the foot of israel from off the land which i have appointed for your fathers if only they will observe to do all that i have commanded them even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by moses 
manasseh seduced judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that they did more evil than the nations whom yahweh destroyed before the children of israel did 
yahweh spoke to manasseh and to his people but they gave no heed 
therefore yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of assyria who took manasseh in chains and bound him with fetters and carried him to babylon 
when he was in distress he begged yahweh his god and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers 
he prayed to him and he was entreated by him and heard his supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom then manasseh knew that yahweh was god 
now after this he built an outer wall to the city of david on the west side of gihon in the valley even to the entrance at the fish gate and he encircled ophel with it and raised it up to a very great height and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of judah 
he took away the foreign gods and the idol out of the house of yahweh and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of yahweh and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city 
he built up the altar of yahweh and offered thereon sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving and commanded judah to serve yahweh the god of israel 
nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places but only to yahweh their god 
now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer to his god and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of yahweh the god of israel behold they are written among the acts of the kings of israel 
his prayer also and how god was entreated of him and all his sin and his trespass and the places in which he built high places and set up the asherim and the engraved images before he humbled himself behold they are written in the history of hozai 
so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house and amon his son reigned in his place 
amon was twenty two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in jerusalem 
he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh as did manasseh his father and amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which manasseh his father had made and served them 
he didn t humble himself before yahweh as manasseh his father had humbled himself but this same amon trespassed more and more 
his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house 
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his place 
josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty one years in jerusalem 
he did that which was right in the eyes of yahweh and walked in the ways of david his father and didn t turn aside to the right hand or to the left 
for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and the asherim and the engraved images and the molten images 
they broke down the altars of the baals in his presence and the incense altars that were on high above them he cut down and the asherim and the engraved images and the molten images he broke in pieces and made dust of them and strewed it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them 
he burnt the bones of the priests on their altars and purged judah and jerusalem 
he did this in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeon even to naphtali around in their ruins 
he broke down the altars and beat the asherim and the engraved images into powder and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of israel and returned to jerusalem 
now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to repair the house of yahweh his god 
they came to hilkiah the high priest and delivered the money that was brought into god s house which the levites the keepers of the threshold had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and of the inhabitants of jerusalem 
they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of yahweh and the workmen who labored in the house of yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house 
even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it to buy cut stone and timber for couplings and to make beams for the houses which the kings of judah had destroyed 
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of yahweh hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of yahweh given by moses 
hilkiah answered shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of yahweh hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan 
shaphan carried the book to the king and moreover brought back word to the king saying all that was committed to your servants they are doing 
they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of yahweh and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and into the hand of the workmen 
shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book shaphan read therein before the king 
it happened when the king had heard the words of the law that he tore his clothes 
the king commanded hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah the king s servant saying 
 go inquire of yahweh for me and for those who are left in israel and in judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of yahweh that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of yahweh to do according to all that is written in this book 
so hilkiah and they whom the king had commanded went to huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tokhath the son of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she lived in jerusalem in the second quarter and they spoke to her to that effect 
she said to them thus says yahweh the god of israel tell the man who sent you to me 
 thus says yahweh behold i will bring evil on this place and on its inhabitants even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of judah 
because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore is my wrath poured out on this place and it shall not be quenched 
but to the king of judah who sent you to inquire of yahweh thus you shall tell him thus says yahweh the god of israel as touching the words which you have heard 
because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before god when you heard his words against this place and against its inhabitants and have humbled yourself before me and have torn your clothes and wept before me i also have heard you says yahweh 
 behold i will gather you to your fathers and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace neither shall your eyes see all the evil that i will bring on this place and on its inhabitants they brought back word to the king 
then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah and jerusalem 
the king went up to the house of yahweh and all the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and the levites and all the people both great and small and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of yahweh 
the king stood in his place and made a covenant before yahweh to walk after yahweh and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book 
he caused all who were found in jerusalem and benjamin to stand the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the covenant of god the god of their fathers 
josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of israel and made all who were found in israel to serve even to serve yahweh their god all his days they didn t depart from following yahweh the god of their fathers 
josiah kept a passover to yahweh in jerusalem and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month 
he set the priests in their offices and encouraged them to the service of the house of yahweh 
he said to the levites who taught all israel who were holy to yahweh put the holy ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel built there shall no more be a burden on your shoulders now serve yahweh your god and his people israel 
prepare yourselves after your fathers houses by your divisions according to the writing of david king of israel and according to the writing of solomon his son 
stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers houses of your brothers the children of the people and let there be for each a portion of a fathers house of the levites 
kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare for your brothers to do according to the word of yahweh by moses 
josiah gave to the children of the people of the flock lambs and young goats all of them for the passover offerings to all who were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand bulls these were of the king s substance 
his princes gave for a freewill offering to the people to the priests and to the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel the rulers of god s house gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small livestock and three hundred head of cattle 
conaniah also and shemaiah and nethanel his brothers and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad the chiefs of the levites gave to the levites for the passover offerings five thousand small livestock and five hundred head of cattle 
so the service was prepared and the priests stood in their place and the levites by their divisions according to the king s commandment 
they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand and the levites flayed them 
they removed the burnt offerings that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers houses of the children of the people to offer to yahweh as it is written in the book of moses so they did with the cattle 
they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance and the holy offerings boiled they in pots and in caldrons and in pans and carried them quickly to all the children of the people 
afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests because the priests the sons of aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron 
the singers the sons of asaph were in their place according to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the king s seer and the porters were at every gate they didn t need to depart from their service for their brothers the levites prepared for them 
so all the service of yahweh was prepared the same day to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of yahweh according to the commandment of king josiah 
the children of israel who were present kept the passover at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days 
there was no passover like that kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet neither did any of the kings of israel keep such a passover as josiah kept and the priests and the levites and all judah and israel who were present and the inhabitants of jerusalem 
in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover kept 
after all this when josiah had prepared the temple neco king of egypt went up to fight against carchemish by the euphrates and josiah went out against him 
but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with you you king of judah ? i come not against you this day but against the house with which i have war god has commanded me to make haste beware that it is god who is with me that he not destroy you 
nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and didn t listen to the words of neco from the mouth of god and came to fight in the valley of megiddo 
the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his servants take me away because i am seriously wounded ! 
so his servants took him out of the chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had and brought him to jerusalem and he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah 
jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men and singing women spoke of josiah in their lamentations to this day and they made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in the lamentations 
then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and made him king in his father s place in jerusalem 
joahaz was twenty three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem 
the king of egypt deposed him at jerusalem and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold 
the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem and changed his name to jehoiakim neco took joahaz his brother and carried him to egypt 
jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh his god 
against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon 
nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of yahweh to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon 
now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations which he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son reigned in his place 
jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh 
at the return of the year king nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of yahweh and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem 
zedekiah was twenty one years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of yahweh his god he didn t humble himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of yahweh 
he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to yahweh the god of israel 
moreover all the chiefs of the priests and the people trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations and they polluted the house of yahweh which he had made holy in jerusalem 
yahweh the god of their fathers sent to them by his messengers rising up early and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place 
but they mocked the messengers of god and despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of yahweh arose against his people until there was no remedy 
therefore he brought on them the king of the chaldeans who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion on young man or virgin old man or gray headed he gave them all into his hand 
all the vessels of god s house great and small and the treasures of the house of yahweh and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon 
they burnt god s house and broke down the wall of jerusalem and burnt all its palaces with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it 
he carried those who had escaped from the sword away to babylon and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of persia 
to fulfill the word of yahweh by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath to fulfill seventy years 
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of yahweh by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished yahweh stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying 
 thus says cyrus king of persia yahweh the god of heaven has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me and he has commanded me to build him a house in jerusalem which is in judah whoever there is among you of all his people yahweh his god be with him and let him go up 
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of yahweh by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished yahweh stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying 
 thus says cyrus king of persia yahweh the god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has commanded me to build him a house in jerusalem which is in judah 
whoever there is among you of all his people may his god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and build the house of yahweh the god of israel he is god which is in jerusalem 
whoever is left in any place where he lives let the men of his place help him with silver with gold with goods and with animals besides the freewill offering for god s house which is in jerusalem 
then the heads of fathers households of judah and benjamin and the priests and the levites even all whose spirit god had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of yahweh which is in jerusalem 
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver with gold with goods and with animals and with precious things besides all that was willingly offered 
also cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of yahweh which nebuchadnezzar had brought out of jerusalem and had put in the house of his gods 
even those cyrus king of persia brought out by the hand of mithredath the treasurer and numbered them to sheshbazzar the prince of judah 
this is the number of them thirty platters of gold one thousand platters of silver twenty nine knives 
thirty bowls of gold silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten and other vessels one thousand 
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred sheshbazzar brought all these up when the captives were brought up from babylon to jerusalem 
now these are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away to babylon and who returned to jerusalem and judah everyone to his city

these were those who went up from tel melah tel harsha cherub addan and immer but they could not show their fathers houses and their seed whether they were of israel 
the children of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of nekoda six hundred fifty two 
of the children of the priests the children of habaiah the children of hakkoz the children of barzillai who took a wife of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite and was called after their name 
these sought their place among those who were registered by genealogy but they were not found therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood 
the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things until there stood up a priest with urim and with thummim 
some of the heads of fathers households when they came to the house of yahweh which is in jerusalem offered willingly for god s house to set it up in its place 
they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work sixty one thousand darics of gold and five thousand minas of silver and one hundred priests garments 
so the priests and the levites and some of the people and the singers and the porters and the nethinim lived in their cities and all israel in their cities 
when the seventh month had come and the children of israel were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man to jerusalem 
then jeshua the son of jozadak stood up with his brothers the priests and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and his brothers and built the altar of the god of israel to offer burnt offerings thereon as it is written in the law of moses the man of god 
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands they set the altar on its base and they offered burnt offerings on it to yahweh even burnt offerings morning and evening 
they kept the feast of tents as it is written and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance as the duty of every day required 
and afterward the continual burnt offering the offerings of the new moons of all the set feasts of yahweh that were consecrated and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to yahweh 
from the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to yahweh but the foundation of yahweh s temple was not yet laid 
they also gave money to the masons and to the carpenters they also gave food drink and oil to the people of sidon and tyre to bring cedar trees from lebanon to the sea to joppa according to the grant that they had from cyrus king of persia 
now in the second year of their coming to god s house at jerusalem in the second month zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the levites and all those who had come out of the captivity to jerusalem began the work and appointed the levites from twenty years old and upward to have the oversight of the work of yahweh s house 
then jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers kadmiel and his sons the sons of judah together to have the oversight of the workmen in god s house the sons of henadad with their sons and their brothers the levites 
when the builders laid the foundation of yahweh s temple they set the priests in their clothing with trumpets with the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals to praise yahweh according to the directions of david king of israel 
they sang to one another in praising and giving thanks to yahweh for he is good for his loving kindness endures forever toward israel all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised yahweh because the foundation of the house of yahweh had been laid 
but many of the priests and levites and heads of fathers households the old men who had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice many also shouted aloud for joy 
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard far away 
now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to yahweh the god of israel 
then they drew near to zerubbabel and to the heads of fathers households and said to them let us build with you for we seek your god as you do and we sacrifice to him since the days of esar haddon king of assyria who brought us up here 
but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers households of israel said to them you have nothing to do with us in building a house to our god but we ourselves together will build to yahweh the god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia has commanded us 
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah and troubled them in building 
and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus king of persia even until the reign of darius king of persia 
in the reign of ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem 
in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam mithredath tabeel and the rest of his companions to artaxerxes king of persia and the writing of the letter was written in syrian and set forth in the syrian language 
rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort 
then rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companions the dinaites and the apharsathchites the tarpelites the apharsites the archevites the babylonians the shushanchites the dehaites the elamites 
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble osnappar brought over and set in the city of samaria and in the rest of the country beyond the river and so forth wrote 
this is the copy of the letter that they sent to artaxerxes the king your servants the men beyond the river and so forth 
be it known to the king that the jews who came up from you have come to us to jerusalem they are building the rebellious and the bad city and have finished the walls and repaired the foundations 
be it known now to the king that if this city is built and the walls finished they will not pay tribute custom or toll and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings 
now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not appropriate for us to see the king s dishonor therefore have we sent and informed the king 
that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers so you shall find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful to kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time for which cause was this city laid waste 
we inform the king that if this city be built and the walls finished by this means you shall have no portion beyond the river 
then the king sent an answer to rehum the chancellor and to shimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions who dwell in samaria and in the rest of the country beyond the river peace and so forth 
the letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me 
i decreed and search has been made and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein 
there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem who have ruled over all the country beyond the river and tribute custom and toll was paid to them 
make a decree now to cause these men to cease and that this city not be built until a decree shall be made by me 
take heed that you not be slack herein why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
then when the copy of king artaxerxes letter was read before rehum and shimshai the scribe and their companions they went in haste to jerusalem to the jews and made them to cease by force and power 
then ceased the work of god s house which is at jerusalem and it ceased until the second year of the reign of darius king of persia 
now the prophets haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo prophesied to the jews who were in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel they prophesied to them 
then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and began to build god s house which is at jerusalem and with them were the prophets of god helping them 
at the same time came to them tattenai the governor beyond the river and shetharbozenai and their companions and said thus to them who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this wall ? 
then we told them in this way what the names of the men were who were making this building 
but the eye of their god was on the elders of the jews and they did not make them cease until the matter should come to darius and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it 
the copy of the letter that tattenai the governor beyond the river and shetharbozenai and his companions the apharsachites who were beyond the river sent to darius the king 
they sent a letter to him in which was written thus to darius the king all peace 
be it known to the king that we went into the province of judah to the house of the great god which is built with great stones and timber is laid in the walls and this work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands 
then we asked those elders and said to them thus who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this wall ? 
we asked them their names also to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head 
thus they returned us answer saying we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth and are building the house that was built these many years ago which a great king of israel built and finished 
but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven to wrath he gave them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon the chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the people away into babylon 
but in the first year of cyrus king of babylon cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of god 
the gold and silver vessels also of god s house which nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in jerusalem and brought into the temple of babylon those cyrus the king took out of the temple of babylon and they were delivered to one whose name was sheshbazzar whom he had made governor 
and he said to him take these vessels go put them in the temple that is in jerusalem and let god s house be built in its place 
then the same sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of god s house which is in jerusalem and since that time even until now has it been in building and yet it is not completed 
now therefore if it seem good to the king let a search be made in the king s treasure house which is there at babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of cyrus the king to build this house of god at jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter 
then darius the king made a decree and search was made in the house of the archives where the treasures were laid up in babylon 
there was found at achmetha in the palace that is in the province of media a scroll and therein was thus written for a record 
in the first year of cyrus the king cyrus the king made a decree concerning god s house at jerusalem let the house be built the place where they offer sacrifices and let its foundations be strongly laid its height sixty cubits and its breadth sixty cubits 
with three courses of great stones and a course of new timber and let the expenses be given out of the king s house 
also let the gold and silver vessels of god s house which nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at jerusalem and brought to babylon be restored and brought again to the temple which is at jerusalem everyone to its place and you shall put them in god s house 
now therefore tattenai governor beyond the river shetharbozenai and your companions the apharsachites who are beyond the river you must stay far from there 
leave the work of this house of god alone let the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews build this house of god in its place 
moreover i make a decree what you shall do to these elders of the jews for the building of this house of god that of the king s goods even of the tribute beyond the river expenses be given with all diligence to these men that they be not hindered 
that which they have need of both young bulls and rams and lambs for burnt offerings to the god of heaven also wheat salt wine and oil according to the word of the priests who are at jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail 
that they may offer sacrifices of pleasant aroma to the god of heaven and pray for the life of the king and of his sons 
also i have made a decree that whoever shall alter this word let a beam be pulled out from his house and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon and let his house be made a dunghill for this 
and the god who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who shall put forth their hand to alter the same to destroy this house of god which is at jerusalem i darius have made a decree let it be done with all diligence 
then tattenai the governor beyond the river shetharbozenai and their companions because darius the king had sent a decree did accordingly with all diligence 
the elders of the jews built and prospered through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo they built and finished it according to the commandment of the god of israel and according to the decree of cyrus and darius and artaxerxes king of persia 
this house was finished on the third day of the month adar which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king 
the children of israel the priests and the levites and the rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of this house of god with joy 
they offered at the dedication of this house of god one hundred bulls two hundred rams four hundred lambs and for a sin offering for all israel twelve male goats according to the number of the tribes of israel 
they set the priests in their divisions and the levites in their courses for the service of god which is at jerusalem as it is written in the book of moses 
the children of the captivity kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month 
for the priests and the levites had purified themselves together all of them were pure and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity and for their brothers the priests and for themselves 
the children of israel who had come again out of the captivity and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land to seek yahweh the god of israel ate 
and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy for yahweh had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of assyria to them to strengthen their hands in the work of god s house the god of israel 
now after these things in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia ezra the son of seraiah the son of azariah the son of hilkiah 
the son of shallum the son of zadok the son of ahitub 
the son of amariah the son of azariah the son of meraioth 
the son of zerahiah the son of uzzi the son of bukki 
the son of abishua the son of phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the chief priest 
this ezra went up from babylon and he was a ready scribe in the law of moses which yahweh the god of israel had given and the king granted him all his request according to the hand of yahweh his god on him 
there went up some of the children of israel and of the priests and the levites and the singers and the porters and the nethinim to jerusalem in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king 
he came to jerusalem in the fifth month which was in the seventh year of the king 
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from babylon and on the first day of the fifth month came he to jerusalem according to the good hand of his god on him 
for ezra had set his heart to seek the law of yahweh and to do it and to teach in israel statutes and ordinances 
now this is the copy of the letter that the king artaxerxes gave to ezra the priest the scribe even the scribe of the words of the commandments of yahweh and of his statutes to israel 
artaxerxes king of kings to ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven perfect and so forth 
i make a decree that all those of the people of israel and their priests and the levites in my realm who are minded of their own free will to go to jerusalem go with you 
because you are sent of the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning judah and jerusalem according to the law of your god which is in your hand 
and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the god of israel whose habitation is in jerusalem 
and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of babylon with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests offering willingly for the house of their god which is in jerusalem 
therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls rams lambs with their meal offerings and their drink offerings and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your god which is in jerusalem 
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold do that after the will of your god 
the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your god deliver before the god of jerusalem 
whatever more shall be needful for the house of your god which you shall have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the king s treasure house 
i even i artaxerxes the king do make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the river that whatever ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven shall require of you it be done with all diligence 
to one hundred talents of silver and to one hundred measures of wheat and to one hundred baths of wine and to one hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribing how much 
whatever is commanded by the god of heaven let it be done exactly for the house of the god of heaven for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
also we inform you that touching any of the priests and levites the singers porters nethinim or servants of this house of god it shall not be lawful to impose tribute custom or toll on them 
you ezra after the wisdom of your god who is in your hand appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people who are beyond the river all such as know the laws of your god and teach him who doesn t know them 
whoever will not do the law of your god and the law of the king let judgment be executed on him with all diligence whether it be to death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to imprisonment 
blessed be yahweh the god of our fathers who has put such a thing as this in the king s heart to beautify the house of yahweh which is in jerusalem 
and has extended loving kindness to me before the king and his counselors and before all the king s mighty princes i was strengthened according to the hand of yahweh my god on me and i gathered together out of israel chief men to go up with me 
now these are the heads of their fathers households and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from babylon in the reign of artaxerxes the king 
of the sons of phinehas gershom of the sons of ithamar daniel of the sons of david hattush 
of the sons of shecaniah of the sons of parosh zechariah and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males one hundred fifty 
of the sons of pahathmoab eliehoenai the son of zerahiah and with him two hundred males 
of the sons of shecaniah the son of jahaziel and with him three hundred males 
of the sons of adin ebed the son of jonathan and with him fifty males 
of the sons of elam jeshaiah the son of athaliah and with him seventy males 
of the sons of shephatiah zebadiah the son of michael and with him eighty males 
of the sons of joab obadiah the son of jehiel and with him two hundred and eighteen males 
of the sons of shelomith the son of josiphiah and with him one hundred sixty males 
of the sons of bebai zechariah the son of bebai and with him twenty eight males 
of the sons of azgad johanan the son of hakkatan and with him one hundred ten males 
of the sons of adonikam who were the last and these are their names eliphelet jeuel and shemaiah and with them sixty males 
of the sons of bigvai uthai and zabbud and with them seventy males 
i gathered them together to the river that runs to ahava and there we encamped three days and i viewed the people and the priests and found there none of the sons of levi 
then sent i for eliezer for ariel for shemaiah and for elnathan and for jarib and for elnathan and for nathan and for zechariah and for meshullam chief men also for joiarib and for elnathan who were teachers 
i sent them forth to iddo the chief at the place casiphia and i told them what they should tell iddo and his brothers the nethinim at the place casiphia that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our god 
according to the good hand of our god on us they brought us a man of discretion of the sons of mahli the son of levi the son of israel and sherebiah with his sons and his brothers eighteen 
and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his brothers and their sons twenty 
and of the nethinim whom david and the princes had given for the service of the levites two hundred and twenty nethinim all of them were mentioned by name 
then i proclaimed a fast there at the river ahava that we might humble ourselves before our god to seek of him a straight way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance 
for i was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken to the king saying the hand of our god is on all those who seek him for good but his power and his wrath is against all those who forsake him 
so we fasted and begged our god for this and he was entreated of us 
then i set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests even sherebiah hashabiah and ten of their brothers with them 
and weighed to them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offering for the house of our god which the king and his counselors and his princes and all israel there present had offered 
i weighed into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver and silver vessels one hundred talents of gold one hundred talents 
and twenty bowls of gold of one thousand darics and two vessels of fine bright brass precious as gold 
i said to them you are holy to yahweh and the vessels are holy and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to yahweh the god of your fathers 
watch and keep them until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the levites and the princes of the fathers households of israel at jerusalem in the rooms of the house of yahweh 
so the priests and the levites received the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels to bring them to jerusalem to the house of our god 
then we departed from the river ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to jerusalem and the hand of our god was on us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the bandit by the way 
we came to jerusalem and stayed there three days 
on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our god into the hand of meremoth the son of uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and with them was jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of binnui the levite 
the whole by number and by weight and all the weight was written at that time 
the children of the captivity who had come out of exile offered burnt offerings to the god of israel twelve bulls for all israel ninety six rams seventy seven lambs and twelve male goats for a sin offering all this was a burnt offering to yahweh 
they delivered the king s commissions to the king s satraps and to the governors beyond the river and they furthered the people and god s house 
now when these things were done the princes drew near to me saying the people of israel and the priests and the levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands following their abominations even those of the canaanites the hittites the perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians and the amorites 
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands yes the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass 
when i heard this thing i tore my garment and my robe and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down confounded 
then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the god of israel because of their trespass of the captivity and i sat confounded until the evening offering 
at the evening offering i arose up from my humiliation even with my garment and my robe torn and i fell on my knees and spread out my hands to yahweh my god 
and i said my god i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you my god for our iniquities have increased over our head and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens 
since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty to this day and for our iniquities we our kings and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity to plunder and to confusion of face as it is this day 
now for a little moment grace has been shown from yahweh our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage 
 now our god what shall we say after this ? for we have forsaken your commandments 
which you have commanded by your servants the prophets saying the land to which you go to possess it is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands through their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness 
now therefore don t give your daughters to their sons neither take their daughters to your sons nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever 
 after all that has come on us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt since you our god have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have given us such a remnant 
shall we again break your commandments and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations ? wouldn t you be angry with us until you had consumed us so that there should be no remnant nor any to escape ?
yahweh the god of israel you are righteous for we are left a remnant that has escaped as it is this day behold we are before you in our guiltiness for none can stand before you because of this 
now while ezra prayed and made confession weeping and casting himself down before god s house there was gathered together to him out of israel a very great assembly of men and women and children for the people wept very bitterly 
shecaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam answered ezra we have trespassed against our god and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land yet now there is hope for israel concerning this thing 
now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our god let it be done according to the law 
arise for the matter belongs to you and we are with you be courageous and do it 
then ezra arose and made the chiefs of the priests the levites and all israel to swear that they would do according to this word so they swore 
then ezra rose up from before god s house and went into the room of jehohanan the son of eliashib and when he came there he ate no bread nor drank water for he mourned because of their trespass of the captivity 
they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem to all the children of the captivity that they should gather themselves together to jerusalem 
and that whoever didn t come within three days according to the counsel of the princes and the elders all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity 
then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves together to jerusalem within the three days it was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the broad place before god s house trembling because of this matter and for the great rain 
ezra the priest stood up and said to them you have trespassed and have married foreign women to increase the guilt of israel 
now therefore make confession to yahweh the god of your fathers and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women 
then all the assembly answered with a loud voice as you have said concerning us so must we do 
but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we are not able to stand outside neither is this a work of one day or two for we have greatly transgressed in this matter 
let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and its judges until the fierce wrath of our god be turned from us until this matter is resolved 
only jonathan the son of asahel and jahzeiah the son of tikvah stood up against this and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them 
the children of the captivity did so ezra the priest with certain heads of fathers households after their fathers houses and all of them by their names were set apart and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter 
they made an end with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month 
among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak and his brothers maaseiah and eliezer and jarib and gedaliah 
they gave their hand that they would put away their wives and being guilty they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt

all these had taken foreign wives and some of them had wives by whom they had children 
the words of nehemiah the son of hacaliah now it happened in the month chislev in the twentieth year as i was in shushan the palace 
that hanani one of my brothers came he and certain men out of judah and i asked them concerning the jews who had escaped who were left of the captivity and concerning jerusalem 
they said to me the remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall of jerusalem also is broken down and its gates are burned with fire 
it happened when i heard these words that i sat down and wept and mourned certain days and i fasted and prayed before the god of heaven 
and said i beg you yahweh the god of heaven the great and awesome god who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments 
let your ear now be attentive and your eyes open that you may listen to the prayer of your servant which i pray before you at this time day and night for the children of israel your servants while i confess the sins of the children of israel which we have sinned against you yes i and my father s house have sinned 
we have dealt very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the ordinances which you commanded your servant moses 
 remember i beg you the word that you commanded your servant moses saying if you trespass i will scatter you abroad among the peoples 
but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens yet will i gather them from there and will bring them to the place that i have chosen to cause my name to dwell there 
 now these are your servants and your people whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand 
lord i beg you let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name and please prosper your servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man now i was cup bearer to the king 
it happened in the month nisan in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king when wine was before him that i took up the wine and gave it to the king now i had not been sad before in his presence 
the king said to me why is your face sad since you are not sick ? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then i was very much afraid 
i said to the king let the king live forever ! why shouldn t my face be sad when the city the place of my fathers tombs lies waste and its gates have been consumed with fire ? 
then the king said to me for what do you make request ? so i prayed to the god of heaven 
i said to the king if it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in your sight that you would send me to judah to the city of my fathers tombs that i may build it 
the king said to me the queen was also sitting by him for how long shall your journey be ? and when will you return ? so it pleased the king to send me and i set him a time 
moreover i said to the king if it pleases the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may let me pass through until i come to judah 
and a letter to asaph the keeper of the king s forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple for the wall of the city and for the house that i shall enter into the king granted my requests because of the good hand of my god on me 
then i came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king s letters now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen 
when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of israel 
i went out by night by the valley gate even toward the jackal s well and to the dung gate and viewed the walls of jerusalem which were broken down and its gates were consumed with fire 
then i went on to the spring gate and to the king s pool but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass 
then went i up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall and i turned back and entered by the valley gate and so returned 
the rulers didn t know where i went or what i did neither had i as yet told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest who did the work 
then i said to them you see the evil case that we are in how jerusalem lies waste and its gates are burned with fire come let us build up the wall of jerusalem that we won t be disgraced 
i told them of the hand of my god which was good on me as also of the king s words that he had spoken to me they said let s rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for the good work 
but when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite and geshem the arabian heard it they ridiculed us and despised us and said what is this thing that you are doing ? will you rebel against the king ? 
then answered i them and said to them the god of heaven will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build but you have no portion nor right nor memorial in jerusalem

between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs 
but it happened that when sanballat heard that we were building the wall he was angry and took great indignation and mocked the jews 
he spoke before his brothers and the army of samaria and said what are these feeble jews doing ? will they fortify themselves ? will they sacrifice ? will they finish in a day ? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish since they are burned ? 
now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said what they are building if a fox climbed up it he would break down their stone wall 
 hear our god for we are despised and turn back their reproach on their own head give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity 
don t cover their iniquity and don t let their sin be blotted out from before you for they have insulted the builders 
so we built the wall and all the wall was joined together to half its height for the people had a mind to work 
but it happened that when sanballat tobiah the arabians the ammonites and the ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of jerusalem went forward and that the breaches began to be filled then they were very angry 
and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against jerusalem and to cause confusion therein 
but we made our prayer to our god and set a watch against them day and night because of them 
judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is fading and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall 
our adversaries said they shall not know neither see until we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease 
it happened that when the jews who lived by them came they said to us ten times from all places wherever you turn they will attack us 
therefore set i in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall in the open places i set the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bows 
i looked and rose up and said to the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people don t be afraid of them ! remember the lord who is great and awesome and fight for your brothers your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses 
it happened when our enemies heard that it was known to us and god had brought their counsel to nothing that we returned all of us to the wall everyone to his work 
it happened from that time forth that half of my servants worked in the work and half of them held the spears the shields and the bows and the coats of mail and the rulers were behind all the house of judah 
they all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves everyone with one of his hands worked in the work and with the other held his weapon 
and the builders everyone wore his sword at his side and so built he who sounded the trumpet was by me 
i said to the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large and we are separated on the wall one far from another 
wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet rally there to us our god will fight for us 
so we worked in the work and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared 
likewise at the same time said i to the people let everyone with his servant lodge within jerusalem that in the night they may be a guard to us and may labor in the day 
so neither i nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me none of us took off our clothes everyone took his weapon to the water 
then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the jews 
for there were that said we our sons and our daughters are many let us get grain that we may eat and live 
some also there were that said we are mortgaging our fields and our vineyards and our houses let us get grain because of the famine 
there were also some who said we have borrowed money for the king s tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral 
yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers our children as their children behold we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants and some of our daughters have been brought into bondage neither is it in our power to help it for other men have our fields and our vineyards 
i was very angry when i heard their cry and these words 
then i consulted with myself and contended with the nobles and the rulers and said to them you exact usury everyone of his brother i held a great assembly against them 
i said to them we after our ability have redeemed our brothers the jews that were sold to the nations and would you even sell your brothers and should they be sold to us ? then they held their peace and found never a word 
also i said the thing that you do is not good ought you not to walk in the fear of our god because of the reproach of the nations our enemies ?
i likewise my brothers and my servants lend them money and grain please let us stop this usury 
please restore to them even this day their fields their vineyards their olive groves and their houses also the hundredth part of the money and of the grain the new wine and the oil that you are charging them 
then they said we will restore them and will require nothing of them so will we do even as you say then i called the priests and took an oath of them that they would do according to this promise 
also i shook out my lap and said so may god shake out every man from his house and from his labor that doesn t perform this promise even thus be he shaken out and emptied all the assembly said amen and praised yahweh the people did according to this promise 
moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor in the land of judah from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king that is twelve years i and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor 
but the former governors who were before me were supported by the people and took bread and wine from them besides forty shekels of silver yes even their servants ruled over the people but i didn t do so because of the fear of god 
yes also i continued in the work of this wall neither bought we any land and all my servants were gathered there to the work 
moreover there were at my table of the jews and the rulers one hundred fifty men besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us 
now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine yet for all this i didn t demand the bread of the governor because the bondage was heavy on this people 
remember to me my god for good all that i have done for this people 
now it happened when it was reported to sanballat and tobiah and to geshem the arabian and to the rest of our enemies that i had built the wall and that there was no breach left therein though even to that time i had not set up the doors in the gates 
that sanballat and geshem sent to me saying come let us meet together in the villages in the plain of ono but they intended to harm me 
i sent messengers to them saying i am doing a great work so that i can t come down why should the work cease while i leave it and come down to you ? 
they sent to me four times after this sort and i answered them the same way 
then sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand 
in which was written it is reported among the nations and gashmu says it that you and the jews intend to rebel because of that you are building the wall you would be their king according to these words 
you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at jerusalem saying there is a king in judah ! now it will be reported to the king according to these words come now therefore and let us take counsel together 
then i sent to him saying there are no such things done as you say but you imagine them out of your own heart 
for they all would have made us afraid saying their hands will be weakened from the work that it not be done but now strengthen my hands 
i went to the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabel who was shut in at his home and he said let us meet together in god s house within the temple and let us shut the doors of the temple for they will come to kill you yes in the night will they come to kill you 
i said should such a man as i flee ? who is there that being such as i would go into the temple to save his life ? i will not go in 
i discerned and behold god had not sent him but he pronounced this prophecy against me tobiah and sanballat had hired him 
he hired so that i would be afraid do so and sin and that they might have material for an evil report that they might reproach me 
 remember my god tobiah and sanballat according to these their works and also the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear 
so the wall was finished in the twenty fifth day of elul in fifty two days 
it happened when all our enemies heard of it that all the nations that were about us were afraid and were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was worked of our god 
moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters to tobiah and tobiah s letters came to them 
for there were many in judah sworn to him because he was the son in law of shecaniah the son of arah and his son jehohanan had taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah as wife 
also they spoke of his good deeds before me and reported my words to him tobiah sent letters to put me in fear 
now it happened when the wall was built and i had set up the doors and the porters and the singers and the levites were appointed 
that i put my brother hanani and hananiah the governor of the castle in charge of jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared god above many 
i said to them don t let the gates of jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot and while they stand guard let them shut the doors and you bar them and appoint watches of the inhabitants of jerusalem everyone in his watch with everyone near his house 
now the city was wide and large but the people were few therein and the houses were not built 
my god put into my heart to gather together the nobles and the rulers and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy i found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first and i found written therein 
these are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away and who returned to jerusalem and to judah everyone to his city

these were those who went up from tel melah tel harsha cherub addon and immer but they could not show their fathers houses nor their seed whether they were of israel 
the children of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of nekoda six hundred forty two 
of the priests the children of hobaiah the children of hakkoz the children of barzillai who took a wife of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite and was called after their name 
these searched for their geneological records but couldn t find them therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood 
the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things until there stood up a priest with urim and thummim 
some from among the heads of fathers households gave to the work the governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold fifty basins and five hundred thirty priests garments 
some of the heads of fathers households gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand two hundred minas of silver 
that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand minas of silver and sixty seven priests garments 
so the priests and the levites and the porters and the singers and some of the people and the nethinim and all israel lived in their cities when the seventh month had come the children of israel were in their cities 
all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate and they spoke to ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which yahweh had commanded to israel 
ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly both men and women and all who could hear with understanding on the first day of the seventh month 
he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday in the presence of the men and the women and of those who could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law 
ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood mattithiah and shema and anaiah and uriah and hilkiah and maaseiah on his right hand and on his left hand pedaiah and mishael and malchijah and hashum and hashbaddanah zechariah and meshullam 
ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up 
and ezra blessed yahweh the great god all the people answered amen amen with the lifting up of their hands they bowed their heads and worshiped yahweh with their faces to the ground 
also jeshua and bani and sherebiah jamin akkub shabbethai hodiah maaseiah kelita azariah jozabad hanan pelaiah and the levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stayed in their place 
they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and they gave the sense so that they understood the reading 
nehemiah who was the governor and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites who taught the people said to all the people this day is holy to yahweh your god don t mourn nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law 
then he said to them go your way eat the fat drink the sweet and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy to our lord don t be grieved for the joy of yahweh is your strength 
so the levites stilled all the people saying hold your peace for the day is holy neither be grieved 
all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared to them 
on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers households of all the people the priests and the levites to ezra the scribe even to give attention to the words of the law 
so the people went out and brought them and made themselves booths everyone on the roof of his house and in their courts and in the courts of god s house and in the broad place of the water gate and in the broad place of the gate of ephraim 
all the assembly of those who had come again out of the captivity made booths and lived in the booths for since the days of jeshua the son of nun to that day the children of israel had not done so there was very great gladness 
also day by day from the first day to the last day he read in the book of the law of god they kept the feast seven days and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according to the ordinance 
now in the twenty fourth day of this month the children of israel were assembled with fasting and with sackcloth and earth on them 
the seed of israel separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers 
they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law of yahweh their god a fourth part of the day and a fourth part they confessed and worshiped yahweh their god 
then jeshua and bani kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani and chenani of the levites stood up on the stairs and cried with a loud voice to yahweh their god 
then the levites jeshua and kadmiel bani hashabneiah sherebiah hodiah shebaniah and pethahiah said stand up and bless yahweh your god from everlasting to everlasting ! bessed be your glorious name which is exalted above all blessing and praise !
you are yahweh even you alone you have made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their army the earth and all things that are on it the seas and all that is in them and you preserve them all the army of heaven worships you 
you are yahweh the god who chose abram and brought him out of ur of the chaldees and gave him the name of abraham 
and found his heart faithful before you and made a covenant with him to give the land of the canaanite the hittite the amorite and the perizzite and the jebusite and the girgashite to give it to his seed and have performed your words for you are righteous 
and showed signs and wonders against pharaoh and against all his servants and against all the people of his land for you knew that they dealt proudly against them and made a name for yourself as it is this day 
you divided the sea before them so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land and you cast their pursuers into the depths as a stone into the mighty waters 
moreover in a pillar of cloud you led them by day and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light in the way in which they should go 
 you came down also on mount sinai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them right ordinances and true laws good statutes and commandments 
and made known to them your holy sabbath and commanded them commandments and statutes and a law by moses your servant 
and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them 
 but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck didn t listen to your commandments 
and refused to obey neither were they mindful of your wonders that you did among them but hardened their neck and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage but you are a god ready to pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness and didn t forsake them 
yes when they had made them a molten calf and said this is your god who brought you up out of egypt and had committed awful blasphemies 
yet you in your manifold mercies didn t forsake them in the wilderness the pillar of cloud didn t depart from over them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night to show them light and the way in which they should go 
you gave also your good spirit to instruct them and didn t withhold your manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst 
 yes forty years you sustained them in the wilderness they lacked nothing their clothes didn t grow old and their feet didn t swell 
moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples which you allotted according to their portions so they possessed the land of sihon even the land of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan 
you also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers that they should go in to possess it 
 so the children went in and possessed the land and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land the canaanites and gave them into their hands with their kings and the peoples of the land that they might do with them as they pleased 
they took fortified cities and a rich land and possessed houses full of all good things cisterns dug out vineyards and olive groves and fruit trees in abundance so they ate were filled became fat and delighted themselves in your great goodness 
 nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against you and cast your law behind their back and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you and they committed awful blasphemies 
therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries who distressed them in the time of their trouble when they cried to you you heard from heaven and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries 
but after they had rest they did evil again before you therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies so that they had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried to you you heard from heaven and many times you delivered them according to your mercies 
and testified against them that you might bring them again to your law yet they dealt proudly and didn t listen to your commandments but sinned against your ordinances which if a man does he shall live in them turned their backs stiffened their neck and would not hear 
yet many years you put up with them and testified against them by your spirit through your prophets yet would they not give ear therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands 
 nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them nor forsake them for you are a gracious and merciful god 
now therefore our god the great the mighty and the awesome god who keeps covenant and loving kindness don t let all the travail seem little before you that has come on us on our kings on our princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers and on all your people since the time of the kings of assyria to this day 
however you are just in all that has come on us for you have dealt truly but we have done wickedly 
neither have our kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept your law nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them 
for they have not served you in their kingdom and in your great goodness that you gave them and in the large and rich land which you gave before them neither did they turn from their wicked works 
 behold we are servants this day and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good behold we are servants in it 
it yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins also they have power over our bodies and over our livestock at their pleasure and we are in great distress 
yet for all this we make a sure covenant and write it and our princes our levites and our priests seal it

and if the peoples of the land bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell that we would not buy of them on the sabbath or on a holy day and that we would forego the seventh year and the exaction of every debt 
also we made ordinances for ourselves to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our god 
for the show bread and for the continual meal offering and for the continual burnt offering for the sabbaths for the new moons for the set feasts and for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make atonement for israel and for all the work of the house of our god

the princes of the people lived in jerusalem the rest of the people also cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in jerusalem the holy city and nine parts in the other cities 
the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell in jerusalem 
now these are the chiefs of the province who lived in jerusalem but in the cities of judah everyone lived in his possession in their cities israel the priests and the levites and the nethinim and the children of solomon s servants

moreover the porters akkub talmon and their brothers who kept watch at the gates were one hundred seventy two 
the residue of israel of the priests the levites were in all the cities of judah everyone in his inheritance 
but the nethinim lived in ophel and ziha and gishpa were over the nethinim 
the overseer also of the levites at jerusalem was uzzi the son of bani the son of hashabiah the son of mattaniah the son of mica of the sons of asaph the singers over the business of god s house 
for there was a commandment from the king concerning them and a settled provision for the singers as every day required 
pethahiah the son of meshezabel of the children of zerah the son of judah was at the king s hand in all matters concerning the people 
as for the villages with their fields some of the children of judah lived in kiriath arba and its towns and in dibon and its towns and in jekabzeel and its villages

jeshua became the father of joiakim and joiakim became the father of eliashib and eliashib became the father of joiada

as for the levites in the days of eliashib joiada and johanan and jaddua there were recorded the heads of fathers households also the priests in the reign of darius the persian 
the sons of levi heads of fathers households were written in the book of the chronicles even until the days of johanan the son of eliashib 
the chiefs of the levites hashabiah sherebiah and jeshua the son of kadmiel with their brothers over against them to praise and give thanks according to the commandment of david the man of god watch next to watch 
mattaniah and bakbukiah obadiah meshullam talmon akkub were porters keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates 
these were in the days of joiakim the son of jeshua the son of jozadak and in the days of nehemiah the governor and of ezra the priest the scribe 
at the dedication of the wall of jerusalem they sought the levites out of all their places to bring them to jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness both with giving thanks and with singing with cymbals stringed instruments and with harps 
the priests and the levites purified themselves and they purified the people and the gates and the wall 
then i brought up the princes of judah on the wall and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession one went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate 
and after them went hoshaiah and half of the princes of judah 
and azariah ezra and meshullam 
judah and benjamin and shemaiah and jeremiah 
and certain of the priests sons with trumpets zechariah the son of jonathan the son of shemaiah the son of mattaniah the son of micaiah the son of zaccur the son of asaph 
and his brothers shemaiah and azarel milalai gilalai maai nethanel and judah hanani with the musical instruments of david the man of god and ezra the scribe was before them 
by the spring gate and straight before them they went up by the stairs of the city of david at the ascent of the wall above the house of david even to the water gate eastward 
the other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them and i after them with the half of the people on the wall above the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall 
and above the gate of ephraim and by the old gate and by the fish gate and the tower of hananel and the tower of hammeah even to the sheep gate and they stood still in the gate of the guard 
so stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in god s house and i and the half of the rulers with me 
and the priests eliakim maaseiah miniamin micaiah elioenai zechariah and hananiah with trumpets 
and maaseiah and shemaiah and eleazar and uzzi and jehohanan and malchijah and elam and ezer the singers sang loud with jezrahiah their overseer 
they offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced for god had made them rejoice with great joy and the women also and the children rejoiced so that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afar off 
on that day were men appointed over the rooms for the treasures for the wave offerings for the first fruits and for the tithes to gather into them according to the fields of the cities the portions appointed by the law for the priests and levites for judah rejoiced for the priests and for the levites who waited 
they performed the duty of their god and the duty of the purification and so did the singers and the porters according to the commandment of david and of solomon his son 
for in the days of david and asaph of old there was a chief of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving to god 
all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days of nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters as every day required and they set apart that which was for the levites and the levites set apart that which was for the sons of aaron 
on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of the people and therein was found written that an ammonite and a moabite should not enter into the assembly of god forever 
because they didn t meet the children of israel with bread and with water but hired balaam against them to curse them however our god turned the curse into a blessing 
it came to pass when they had heard the law that they separated from israel all the mixed multitude 
but in all this i was not at jerusalem for in the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon i went to the king and after certain days asked i leave of the king 
and i came to jerusalem and understood the evil that eliashib had done for tobiah in preparing him a room in the courts of god s house 
it grieved me severely therefore i cast forth all the household stuff of tobiah out of the room 
then i commanded and they cleansed the rooms and there brought i again the vessels of god s house with the meal offerings and the frankincense 
i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been given them so that the levites and the singers who did the work had fled everyone to his field 
then i contended with the rulers and said why is god s house forsaken ? i gathered them together and set them in their place 
then brought all judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries 
i made treasurers over the treasuries shelemiah the priest and zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and next to them was hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah for they were counted faithful and their business was to distribute to their brothers 
remember me my god concerning this and don t wipe out my good deeds that i have done for the house of my god and for its observances 
in those days saw i in judah some men treading winepresses on the sabbath and bringing in sheaves and loading donkeys as also wine grapes and figs and all kinds of burdens which they brought into jerusalem on the sabbath day and i testified against them in the day in which they sold food 
there lived men of tyre also therein who brought in fish and all kinds of wares and sold on the sabbath to the children of judah and in jerusalem 
then i contended with the nobles of judah and said to them what evil thing is this that you do and profane the sabbath day ?
didn t your fathers do thus and didn t our god bring all this evil on us and on this city ? yet you bring more wrath on israel by profaning the sabbath 
it came to pass that when the gates of jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath i commanded that the doors should be shut and commanded that they should not be opened until after the sabbath i set some of my servants over the gates that no burden should be brought in on the sabbath day 
so the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of jerusalem once or twice 
then i testified against them and said to them why do you stay around the wall ? if you do so again i will lay hands on you from that time on they didn t come on the sabbath 
i commanded the levites that they should purify themselves and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath day remember to me my god this also and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness 
in those days also saw i the jews who had married women of ashdod of ammon and of moab 
and their children spoke half in the speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language but according to the language of each people 
i contended with them and cursed them and struck certain of them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by god you shall not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves 
didn t solomon king of israel sin by these things ? yet among many nations was there no king like him and he was beloved of his god and god made him king over all israel nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin 
shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil to trespass against our god in marrying foreign women ? 
one of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest was son in law to sanballat the horonite therefore i chased him from me 
remember them my god because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the levites 
thus i cleansed them from all foreigners and appointed duties for the priests and for the levites everyone in his work 
and for the wood offering at times appointed and for the first fruits remember me my god for good 
now it happened in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasuerus who reigned from india even to ethiopia over one hundred twenty seven provinces 
that in those days when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the palace 
in the third year of his reign he made a feast for all his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him 
he displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days even one hundred eighty days 
when these days were fulfilled the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in shushan the palace both great and small in the court of the garden of the king s palace 
there were hangings of white green and blue material fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars the couches were of gold and silver on a pavement of red white yellow and black marble 
they gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds including royal wine in abundance according to the bounty of the king 
in accordance with the law the drinking was not compulsory for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house that they should do according to every man s pleasure 
also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king ahasuerus 
but the queen vashti refused to come at the king s commandment by the eunuchs therefore the king was very angry and his anger burned in him 
then the king said to the wise men who knew the times for it was the king s custom to consult those who knew law and judgment 
and the next to him were carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres marsena and memucan the seven princes of persia and media who saw the king s face and sat first in the kingdom 
 what shall we do to the queen vashti according to law because she has not done the bidding of the king ahasuerus by the eunuchs ? 
memucan answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king but also to all the princes and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus 
for this deed of the queen will become known to all women causing them to show contempt for their husbands when it is reported king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she didn t come 
today the princesses of persia and media who have heard of the queen s deed will tell all the king s princes this will cause much contempt and wrath 
 if it please the king let a royal commandment go from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes so that it cannot be altered that vashti may never again come before king ahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she 
when the king s decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom for it is great all the wives will give their husbands honor both great and small 
this advice pleased the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of memucan 
for he sent letters into all the king s provinces into every province according to its writing and to every people in their language that every man should rule his own house speaking in the language of his own people 
after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was pacified he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her 
then the king s servants who served him said let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king 
let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of susa to the women s house to the custody of hegai the king s eunuch keeper of the women let cosmetics be given them 
and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of vashti the thing pleased the king and he did so 
there was a certain jew in the citadel of susa whose name was mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a benjamite 
who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away 
he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle s daughter for she had neither father nor mother the maiden was fair and beautiful and when her father and mother were dead mordecai took her for his own daughter 
so it happened when the king s commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of susa to the custody of hegai that esther was taken into the king s house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women 
the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness from him he quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king s house he moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women s house 
esther had not made known her people nor her relatives because mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known 
mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women s house to find out how esther was doing and what would become of her 
each young woman s turn came to go in to king ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months for so were the days of their purification accomplished six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women 
the young woman then came to the king like this whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women s house to the king s house 
in the evening she went and on the next day she returned into the second women s house to the custody of shaashgaz the king s eunuch who kept the concubines she came in to the king no more unless the king delighted in her and she was called by name 
now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter came to go in to the king she required nothing but what hegai the king s eunuch the keeper of the women advised esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her 
so esther was taken to king ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his reign 
the king loved esther more than all the women and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of vashti 
then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants even esther s feast and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces and gave gifts according to the king s bounty 
when the virgins were gathered together the second time mordecai was sitting in the king s gate 
esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people as mordecai had commanded her for esther obeyed mordecai like she did when she was brought up by him 
in those days while mordecai was sitting in the king s gate two of the king s eunuchs bigthan and teresh who were doorkeepers were angry and sought to lay hands on the king ahasuerus 
this thing became known to mordecai who informed esther the queen and esther informed the king in mordecai s name 
when this matter was investigated and it was found to be so they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king s presence 
after these things king ahasuerus promoted haman the son of hammedatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him 
all the king s servants who were in the king s gate bowed down and paid homage to haman for the king had so commanded concerning him but mordecai didn t bow down or pay him homage 
then the king s servants who were in the king s gate said to mordecai why do you disobey the king s commandment ? 
now it came to pass when they spoke daily to him and he didn t listen to them that they told haman to see whether mordecai s reason would stand for he had told them that he was a jew 
when haman saw that mordecai didn t bow down nor pay him homage haman was full of wrath 
but he scorned the thought of laying hands on mordecai alone for they had made known to him mordecai s people therefore haman sought to destroy all the jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus even mordecai s people 
in the first month which is the month nisan in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus they cast pur that is the lot before haman from day to day and from month to month and chose the twelfth month which is the month adar 
haman said to king ahasuerus there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom and their laws are different than other people s they don t keep the king s laws therefore it is not for the king s profit to allow them to remain 
if it pleases the king let it be written that they be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king s business to bring it into the king s treasuries 
the king took his ring from his hand and gave it to haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the jews enemy 
the king said to haman the silver is given to you the people also to do with them as it seems good to you 
then the king s scribes were called in on the first month on the thirteenth day of the month and all that haman commanded was written to the king s satraps and to the governors who were over every province and to the princes of every people to every province according its writing and to every people in their language it was written in the name of king ahasuerus and it was sealed with the king s ring 
letters were sent by couriers into all the king s provinces to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all jews both young and old little children and women in one day even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar and to plunder their possessions 
a copy of the letter that the decree should be given out in every province was published to all the peoples that they should be ready against that day 
the couriers went forth in haste by the king s commandment and the decree was given out in the citadel of susa the king and haman sat down to drink but the city of shushan was perplexed 
now when mordecai found out all that was done mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and wailed loudly and a bitterly 
he came even before the king s gate for no one is allowed inside the king s gate clothed with sackcloth 
in every province wherever the king s commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes 
esther s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this and the queen was exceedingly grieved she sent clothing to mordecai to replace his sackcloth but he didn t receive it 
then esther called for hathach one of the king s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her and commanded him to go to mordecai to find out what this was and why it was 
so hathach went out to mordecai to city square which was before the king s gate 
mordecai told him of all that had happened to him and the exact sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the king s treasuries for the destruction of the jews 
he also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in shushan to destroy them to show it to esther and to declare it to her and to urge her to go in to the king to make supplication to him and to make request before him for her people 
hathach came and told esther the words of mordecai 
then esther spoke to hathach and gave him a message to mordecai 
 all the king s servants and the people of the king s provinces know that whoever whether man or woman comes to the king into the inner court without being called there is one law for him that he be put to death except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter that he may live i have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days 
for if you remain silent now then relief and deliverance will come to the jews from another place but you and your father s house will perish who knows if you haven t come to the kingdom for such a time as this ? 
so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him 
now it happened on the third day that esther put on her royal clothing and stood in the inner court of the king s house next to the king s house the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house next to the entrance of the house 
when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court she obtained favor in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hand so esther came near and touched the top of the scepter 
then the king asked her what would you like queen esther ? what is your request ? it shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom 
esther said if it seems good to the king let the king and haman come today to the banquet that i have prepared for him 
then the king said bring haman quickly so that it may be done as esther has said so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared 
the king said to esther at the banquet of wine what is your petition ? it shall be granted you what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed 
then esther answered and said my petition and my request is this 
if i have found favor in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i will prepare for them and i will do tomorrow as the king has said 
then haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart but when haman saw mordecai in the king s gate that he didn t stand up nor move for him he was filled with wrath against mordecai 
nevertheless haman restrained himself and went home there he sent and called for his friends and zeresh his wife 
haman recounted to them the glory of his riches the multitude of his children all the things in which the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king 
haman also said yes esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself and tomorrow i am also invited by her together with the king 
yet all this avails me nothing so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the king s gate 
then zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him let a gallows be made fifty cubits high and in the morning speak to the king about hanging mordecai on it then go in merrily with the king to the banquet this pleased haman so he had the gallows made 
on that night the king couldn t sleep he commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought and they were read to the king 
it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana and teresh two of the king s eunuchs who were doorkeepers who had tried to lay hands on the king ahasuerus 
the king said what honor and dignity has been bestowed on mordecai for this ? then the king s servants who attended him said nothing has been done for him 
the king said who is in the court ? now haman had come into the outer court of the king s house to speak to the king about hanging mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him 
the king s servants said to him behold haman stands in the court the king said let him come in 
so haman came in the king said to him what shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor ? now haman said in his heart who would the king delight to honor more than myself ? 
haman said to the king for the man whom the king delights to honor 
let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear and the horse that the king rides on and on the head of which a crown royal is set 
let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king s most noble princes that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor with them and have him ride on horseback through the city square and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor ! 
then the king said to haman hurry and take the clothing and the horse as you have said and do this for mordecai the jew who sits at the king s gate let nothing fail of all that you have spoken 
then haman took the clothing and the horse and arrayed mordecai and had him ride through the city square and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor ! 
mordecai came back to the king s gate but haman hurried to his house mourning and having his head covered 
haman recounted to zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him then his wise men and zeresh his wife said to him if mordecai before whom you have begun to fall is of jewish descent you will not prevail against him but you will surely fall before him 
while they were yet talking with him the king s eunuchs came and hurried to bring haman to the banquet that esther had prepared 
so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen 
the king said again to esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is your petition queen esther ? it shall be granted you what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed 
then esther the queen answered if i have found favor in your sight o king and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request 
for we are sold i and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for bondservants and bondmaids i would have held my peace although the adversary could not have compensated for the king s loss 
then king ahasuerus said to esther the queen who is he and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so ? 
esther said an adversary and an enemy even this wicked haman ! then haman was afraid before the king and the queen 
the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden haman stood up to make request for his life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king 
then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine and haman had fallen on the couch where esther was then the king said will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house ? as the word went out of the king s mouth they covered haman s face 
then harbonah one of the eunuchs who were with the king said behold the gallows fifty cubits high which haman has made for mordecai who spoke good for the king is standing at haman s house the king said hang him on it ! 
so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai then was the king s wrath pacified 
on that day king ahasuerus gave the house of haman the jews enemy to esther the queen mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was to her 
the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it to mordecai esther set mordecai over the house of haman 
esther spoke yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews 
then the king held out to esther the golden scepter so esther arose and stood before the king 
she said if it pleases the king and if i have found favor in his sight and the thing seem right to the king and i am pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews who are in all the king s provinces 
for how can i endure to see the evil that would come to my people ? how can i endure to see the destruction of my relatives ? 
then king ahasuerus said to esther the queen and to mordecai the jew see i have given esther the house of haman and him they have hanged on the gallows because he laid his hand on the jews 
write also to the jews as it pleases you in the king s name and seal it with the king s ring for the writing which is written in the king s name and sealed with the king s ring may not be reversed by any man 
then the king s scribes were called at that time in the third month sivan on the twenty third day of the month and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded to the jews and to the satraps and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from india to ethiopia one hundred twenty seven provinces to every province according to its writing and to every people in their language and to the jews in their writing and in their language 
he wrote in the name of king ahasuerus and sealed it with the king s ring and sent letters by courier on horseback riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds 
in those letters the king granted the jews who were in every city to gather themselves together and to defend their life to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them their little ones and women and to plunder their possessions 
on one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar 
a copy of the letter that the decree should be given out in every province was published to all the peoples that the jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies 
so the couriers who rode on royal horses went out hastened and pressed on by the king s commandment the decree was given out in the citadel of susa 
mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple and the city of susa shouted and was glad 
the jews had light gladness joy and honor 
in every province and in every city wherever the king s commandment and his decree came the jews had gladness joy a feast and a good day many from among the peoples of the land became jews for the fear of the jews was fallen on them 
now in the twelfth month which is the month adar on the thirteenth day of the month when the king s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution on the day that the enemies of the jews hoped to conquer them but it was turned out the opposite happened that the jews conquered those who hated them 
the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king ahasuerus to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them no one could withstand them because the fear of them had fallen on all the people 
all the princes of the provinces the satraps the governors and those who did the king s business helped the jews because the fear of mordecai had fallen on them 
for mordecai was great in the king s house and his fame went out throughout all the provinces for the man mordecai grew greater and greater 
the jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and with slaughter and destruction and did what they wanted to those who hated them 
in the citadel of susa the jews killed and destroyed five hundred men 
they killed parshandatha dalphon aspatha 
poratha adalia aridatha 
the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the jew s enemy but they didn t lay their hand on the plunder 
on that day the number of those who were slain in the citadel of susa was brought before the king 
the king said to esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of susa including the ten sons of haman what then have they done in the rest of the king s provinces ! now what is your petition ? it shall be granted you what is your further request ? it shall be done 
then esther said if it pleases the king let it be granted to the jews who are in shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day s decree and let haman s ten sons be hanged on the gallows 
the king commanded this to be done a decree was given out in shushan and they hanged haman s ten sons 
the jews who were in shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar and killed three hundred men in shushan but they didn t lay their hand on the spoil 
the other jews who were in the king s provinces gathered themselves together defended their lives had rest from their enemies and killed seventy five thousand of those who hated them but they didn t lay their hand on the plunder 
this was done on the thirteenth day of the month adar and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness 
but the jews who were in shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month and on the fifteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness 
therefore the jews of the villages who live in the unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness and feasting a good day and a day of sending presents of food to one another 
mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the jews who were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both near and far 
to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month adar yearly 
as the days in which the jews had rest from their enemies and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and gladness and of sending presents of food to one another and gifts to the needy 
the jews accepted the custom that they had begun as mordecai had written to them 
because haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the enemy of all the jews had plotted against the jews to destroy them and had cast pur that is the lot to consume them and to destroy them 
but when this became known to the king he commanded by letters that his wicked device which he had devised against the jews should return on his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows 
and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every family every province and every city and that these days of purim should not fail from among the jews nor their memory perish from their seed 
then esther the queen the daughter of abihail and mordecai the jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim 
he sent letters to all the jews to the hundred twenty seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus with words of peace and truth 
to confirm these days of purim in their appointed times as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had decreed and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants in the matter of the fastings and their cry 
the commandment of esther confirmed these matters of purim and it was written in the book 
king ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land and on the islands of the sea 
all the acts of his power and of his might and the full account of the greatness of mordecai to which the king advanced him aren t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of media and persia ?
for mordecai the jew was next to king ahasuerus and great among the jews and accepted by the multitude of his brothers seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his descendants 
there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job that man was blameless and upright and one who feared god and turned away from evil 
there were born to him seven sons and three daughters 
his possessions also were seven thousand sheep three thousand camels five hundred yoke of oxen five hundred female donkeys and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east 
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them 
it was so when the days of their feasting had run their course that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and renounced god in their hearts job did so continually 
now it happened on the day when god s sons came to present themselves before yahweh that satan also came among them 
yahweh said to satan where have you come from ? then satan answered yahweh and said from going back and forth in the earth and from walking up and down in it 
yahweh said to satan have you considered my servant job ? for there is none like him in the earth a blameless and an upright man one who fears god and turns away from evil 
then satan answered yahweh and said does job fear god for nothing ?
haven t you made a hedge around him and around his house and around all that he has on every side ? you have blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land 
but put forth your hand now and touch all that he has and he will renounce you to your face 
yahweh said to satan behold all that he has is in your power only on himself don t put forth your hand so satan went forth from the presence of yahweh 
it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother s house 
that there came a messenger to job and said the oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them 
and the sabeans attacked and took them away yes they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword and i alone have escaped to tell you 
while he was still speaking there also came another and said the fire of god has fallen from the sky and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and i alone have escaped to tell you 
while he was still speaking there came also another and said the chaldeans made three bands and swept down on the camels and have taken them away yes and killed the servants with the edge of the sword and i alone have escaped to tell you 
while he was still speaking there came also another and said your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother s house 
and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house and it fell on the young men and they are dead i alone have escaped to tell you 
then job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell down on the ground and worshiped 
he said naked i came out of my mother s womb and naked shall i return there yahweh gave and yahweh has taken away blessed be the name of yahweh 
in all this job did not sin nor charge god with wrongdoing 
again it happened on the day when the god s sons came to present themselves before yahweh that satan came also among them to present himself before yahweh 
yahweh said to satan where have you come from ? satan answered yahweh and said from going back and forth in the earth and from walking up and down in it 
yahweh said to satan have you considered my servant job ? for there is none like him in the earth a blameless and an upright man one who fears god and turns away from evil he still maintains his integrity although you incited me against him to ruin him without cause 
satan answered yahweh and said skin for skin yes all that a man has he will give for his life 
but put forth your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will renounce you to your face 
yahweh said to satan behold he is in your hand only spare his life 
so satan went forth from the presence of yahweh and struck job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head 
he took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with and he sat among the ashes 
then his wife said to him do you still maintain your integrity ? renounce god and die 
but he said to her you speak as one of the foolish women would speak what ? shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil ? in all this job didn t sin with his lips 
now when job s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him they each came from his own place eliphaz the temanite bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him 
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance and didn t recognize him they raised their voices and wept and they each tore his robe and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky 
so they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights and none spoke a word to him for they saw that his grief was very great 
after this job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth 
let that day be darkness don t let god from above seek for it neither let the light shine on it 
let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own let a cloud dwell on it let all that makes black the day terrify it 
as for that night let thick darkness seize on it let it not rejoice among the days of the year let it not come into the number of the months 
behold let that night be barren let no joyful voice come therein 
let them curse it who curse the day who are ready to rouse up leviathan 
let the stars of its twilight be dark let it look for light but have none neither let it see the eyelids of the morning 
because it didn t shut up the doors of my mother s womb nor did it hide trouble from my eyes 
 why didn t i die from the womb ? why didn t i give up the spirit when my mother bore me ?
why did the knees receive me ? or why the breast that i should nurse ?
for now should i have lain down and been quiet i should have slept then i would have been at rest 
with kings and counselors of the earth who built up waste places for themselves 
or with princes who had gold who filled their houses with silver 
or as a hidden untimely birth i had not been as infants who never saw light 
there the wicked cease from troubling there the weary are at rest 
there the prisoners are at ease together they don t hear the voice of the taskmaster 
the small and the great are there the servant is free from his master 
 why is light given to him who is in misery life to the bitter in soul 
who long for death but it doesn t come and dig for it more than for hidden treasures 
who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave ?
why is light given to a man whose way is hidden whom god has hedged in ?
for my sighing comes before i eat my groanings are poured out like water 
for the thing which i fear comes on me that which i am afraid of comes to me 
i am not at ease neither am i quiet neither have i rest but trouble comes 
then eliphaz the temanite answered 
 if someone ventures to talk with you will you be grieved ? but who can withhold himself from speaking ?
behold you have instructed many you have strengthened the weak hands 
your words have supported him who was falling you have made firm the feeble knees 
but now it has come to you and you faint it touches you and you are troubled 
isn t your piety your confidence ? isn t the integrity of your ways your hope ?
 remember now whoever perished being innocent ? or where were the upright cut off ?
according to what i have seen those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same 
by the breath of god they perish by the blast of his anger are they consumed 
the roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion the teeth of the young lions are broken 
the old lion perishes for lack of prey the cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad 
 now a thing was secretly brought to me my ear received a whisper of it 
in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep falls on men 
fear came on me and trembling which made all my bones shake 
then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood up 
it stood still but i couldn t discern its appearance a form was before my eyes silence then i heard a voice saying 
 shall mortal man be more just than god ? shall a man be more pure than his maker ?
behold he puts no trust in his servants he charges his angels with error 
how much more those who dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust who are crushed before the moth !
between morning and evening they are destroyed they perish forever without any regarding it 
isn t their tent cord plucked up within them ? they die and that without wisdom 
 call now is there any who will answer you ? to which of the holy ones will you turn ?
for resentment kills the foolish man and jealousy kills the simple 
i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly i cursed his habitation 
his children are far from safety they are crushed in the gate neither is there any to deliver them 
whose harvest the hungry eats up and take it even out of the thorns the snare gapes for their substance 
for affliction doesn t come forth from the dust neither does trouble spring out of the ground 
but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward 
 but as for me i would seek god i would commit my cause to god 
who does great things that can t be fathomed marvelous things without number 
who gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields 
so that he sets up on high those who are low those who mourn are exalted to safety 
he frustrates the devices of the crafty so that their hands can t perform their enterprise 
he takes the wise in their own craftiness the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong 
they meet with darkness in the day time and grope at noonday as in the night 
but he saves from the sword of their mouth even the needy from the hand of the mighty 
so the poor has hope and injustice shuts her mouth 
 behold happy is the man whom god corrects therefore do not despise the chastening of the almighty 
for he wounds and binds up he injures and his hands make whole 
he will deliver you in six troubles yes in seven no evil shall touch you 
in famine he will redeem you from death in war from the power of the sword 
you shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes 
at destruction and famine you shall laugh neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth 
for you shall be allied with the stones of the field the animals of the field shall be at peace with you 
you shall know that your tent is in peace you shall visit your fold and shall miss nothing 
you shall know also that your seed shall be great your offspring as the grass of the earth 
you shall come to your grave in a full age like a shock of grain comes in its season 
look this we have searched it so it is hear it and know it for your good 
then job answered 
 oh that my anguish were weighed and all my calamity laid in the balances !
for now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas therefore have my words been rash 
for the arrows of the almighty are within me my spirit drinks up their poison the terrors of god set themselves in array against me 
does the wild donkey bray when he has grass ? or does the ox low over his fodder ?
can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt ? or is there any taste in the white of an egg ?
my soul refuses to touch them they are as loathsome food to me 
 oh that i might have my request that god would grant the thing that i long for 
even that it would please god to crush me that he would let loose his hand and cut me off !
be it still my consolation yes let me exult in pain that doesn t spare that i have not denied the words of the holy one 
what is my strength that i should wait ? what is my end that i should be patient ?
is my strength the strength of stones ? or is my flesh of brass ?
isn t it that i have no help in me that wisdom is driven quite from me ?
 to him who is ready to faint kindness should be shown from his friend even to him who forsakes the fear of the almighty 
my brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook as the channel of brooks that pass away 
which are black by reason of the ice in which the snow hides itself 
in the dry season they vanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their place 
the caravans that travel beside them turn aside they go up into the waste and perish 
the caravans of tema looked the companies of sheba waited for them 
they were distressed because they were confident they came there and were confounded 
for now you are nothing you see a terror and are afraid 
did i say give to me ? or offer a present for me from your substance ? 
or deliver me from the adversary s hand ? or redeem me from the hand of the oppressors ? 
 teach me and i will hold my peace cause me to understand wherein i have erred 
how forcible are words of uprightness ! but your reproof what does it reprove ?
do you intend to reprove words since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind ?
yes you would even cast lots for the fatherless and make merchandise of your friend 
now therefore be pleased to look at me for surely i shall not lie to your face 
please return let there be no injustice yes return again my cause is righteous 
is there injustice on my tongue ? can t my taste discern mischievous things ?
 isn t a man forced to labor on earth ? aren t his days like the days of a hired hand ?
as a servant who earnestly desires the shadow as a hireling who looks for his wages 
so am i made to possess months of misery wearisome nights are appointed to me 
when i lie down i say when shall i arise and the night be gone ? i toss and turn until the dawning of the day 
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin closes up and breaks out afresh 
my days are swifter than a weaver s shuttle and are spent without hope 
oh remember that my life is a breath my eye shall no more see good 
the eye of him who sees me shall see me no more your eyes shall be on me but i shall not be 
as the cloud is consumed and vanishes away so he who goes down to sheol shall come up no more 
he shall return no more to his house neither shall his place know him any more 
 therefore i will not keep silent i will speak in the anguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitterness of my soul 
am i a sea or a sea monster that you put a guard over me ?
when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaint 
then you scare me with dreams and terrify me through visions 
so that my soul chooses strangling death rather than my bones 
i loathe my life i don t want to live forever leave me alone for my days are but a breath 
what is man that you should magnify him that you should set your mind on him 
that you should visit him every morning and test him every moment ?
how long will you not look away from me nor leave me alone until i swallow down my spittle ?
if i have sinned what do i do to you you watcher of men ? why have you set me as a mark for you so that i am a burden to myself ?
why do you not pardon my disobedience and take away my iniquity ? for now shall i lie down in the dust you will seek me diligently but i shall not be 
then bildad the shuhite answered 
 how long will you speak these things ? shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind ?
does god pervert justice ? or does the almighty pervert righteousness ?
if your children have sinned against him he has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience 
if you want to seek god diligently make your supplication to the almighty 
if you were pure and upright surely now he would awaken for you and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous 
though your beginning was small yet your latter end would greatly increase 
 please inquire of past generations find out about the learning of their fathers 
 for we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days on earth are a shadow 
shall they not teach you tell you and utter words out of their heart ?
 can the papyrus grow up without mire ? can the rushes grow without water ?
while it is yet in its greenness not cut down it withers before any other reed 
so are the paths of all who forget god the hope of the godless man shall perish 
whose confidence shall break apart whose trust is a spider s web 
he shall lean on his house but it shall not stand he shall cling to it but it shall not endure 
he is green before the sun his shoots go forth over his garden 
his roots are wrapped around the rock pile he sees the place of stones 
if he is destroyed from his place then it shall deny him saying i have not seen you 
behold this is the joy of his way out of the earth others shall spring 
 behold god will not cast away a blameless man neither will he uphold the evildoers 
he will still fill your mouth with laughter your lips with shouting 
those who hate you shall be clothed with shame the tent of the wicked shall be no more 
then job answered 
 truly i know that it is so but how can man be just with god ?
if he is pleased to contend with him he can t answer him one time in a thousand 
god who is wise in heart and mighty in strength who has hardened himself against him and prospered ?
he removes the mountains and they don t know it when he overturns them in his anger 
he shakes the earth out of its place its pillars tremble 
he commands the sun and it doesn t rise and seals up the stars 
he alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea 
he does great things past finding out yes marvelous things without number 
behold he goes by me and i don t see him he passes on also but i don t perceive him 
behold he snatches away who can hinder him ? who will ask him what are you doing ? 
 god will not withdraw his anger the helpers of rahab stoop under him 
how much less shall i answer him and choose my words to argue with him ?
though i were righteous yet i wouldn t answer him i would make supplication to my judge 
if i had called and he had answered me yet i wouldn t believe that he listened to my voice 
for he breaks me with a storm and multiplies my wounds without cause 
he will not allow me to catch my breath but fills me with bitterness 
if it is a matter of strength behold he is mighty ! if of justice who says he will summon me ? 
though i am righteous my own mouth shall condemn me though i am blameless it shall prove me perverse 
i am blameless i don t respect myself i despise my life 
 it is all the same therefore i say he destroys the blameless and the wicked 
if the scourge kills suddenly he will mock at the trial of the innocent 
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covers the faces of its judges if not he then who is it ?
 now my days are swifter than a runner they flee away they see no good 
they have passed away as the swift ships as the eagle that swoops on the prey 
if i say i will forget my complaint i will put off my sad face and cheer up 
i am afraid of all my sorrows i know that you will not hold me innocent 
i shall be condemned why then do i labor in vain ?
if i wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye 
yet you will plunge me in the ditch my own clothes shall abhor me 
for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him that we should come together in judgment 
there is no umpire between us that might lay his hand on us both 
let him take his rod away from me let his terror not make me afraid 
then i would speak and not fear him for i am not so in myself 
 my soul is weary of my life i will give free course to my complaint i will speak in the bitterness of my soul 
i will tell god do not condemn me show me why you contend with me 
is it good to you that you should oppress that you should despise the work of your hands and smile on the counsel of the wicked ?
do you have eyes of flesh ? or do you see as man sees ?
are your days as the days of mortals or your years as man s years 
that you inquire after my iniquity and search after my sin ?
although you know that i am not wicked there is no one who can deliver out of your hand 
 your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether yet you destroy me 
remember i beg you that you have fashioned me as clay will you bring me into dust again ?
haven t you poured me out like milk and curdled me like cheese ?
you have clothed me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews 
you have granted me life and loving kindness your visitation has preserved my spirit 
yet you hid these things in your heart i know that this is with you 
if i sin then you mark me you will not acquit me from my iniquity 
if i am wicked woe to me if i am righteous i still shall not lift up my head being filled with disgrace and conscious of my affliction 
if my head is held high you hunt me like a lion again you show yourself powerful to me 
you renew your witnesses against me and increase your indignation on me changes and warfare are with me 
 why then have you brought me forth out of the womb ? i wish i had given up the spirit and no eye had seen me 
i should have been as though i had not been i should have been carried from the womb to the grave 
aren t my days few ? cease then leave me alone that i may find a little comfort 
before i go where i shall not return from to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death 
the land dark as midnight of the shadow of death without any order where the light is as midnight 
then zophar the naamathite answered 
 shouldn t the multitude of words be answered ? should a man full of talk be justified ?
should your boastings make men hold their peace ? when you mock shall no man make you ashamed ?
for you say my doctrine is pure i am clean in your eyes 
but oh that god would speak and open his lips against you 
that he would show you the secrets of wisdom ! for true wisdom has two sides know therefore that god exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves 
 can you fathom the mystery of god ? or can you probe the limits of the almighty ?
they are high as heaven what can you do ? they are deeper than sheol what can you know ?
its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea 
if he passes by or confines or convenes a court then who can oppose him ?
for he knows false men he sees iniquity also even though he doesn t consider it 
an empty headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey s colt 
 if you set your heart aright stretch out your hands toward him 
if iniquity is in your hand put it far away don t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents 
surely then you shall lift up your face without spot yes you shall be steadfast and shall not fear 
for you shall forget your misery you shall remember it as waters that are passed away 
life shall be clearer than the noonday though there is darkness it shall be as the morning 
you shall be secure because there is hope yes you shall search and shall take your rest in safety 
also you shall lie down and none shall make you afraid yes many shall court your favor 
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail they shall have no way to flee their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit 
then job answered 
 no doubt but you are the people and wisdom shall die with you 
but i have understanding as well as you i am not inferior to you yes who doesn t know such things as these ?
i am like one who is a joke to his neighbor i who called on god and he answered the just the blameless man is a joke 
in the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune it is ready for them whose foot slips 
the tents of robbers prosper those who provoke god are secure who carry their god in their hands 
 but ask the animals now and they shall teach you the birds of the sky and they shall tell you 
or speak to the earth and it shall teach you the fish of the sea shall declare to you 
who doesn t know that in all these the hand of yahweh has done this 
in whose hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind ?
doesn t the ear try words even as the palate tastes its food ?
with aged men is wisdom in length of days understanding 
 with god is wisdom and might he has counsel and understanding 
behold he breaks down and it can t be built again he imprisons a man and there can be no release 
behold he withholds the waters and they dry up again he sends them out and they overturn the earth 
with him is strength and wisdom the deceived and the deceiver are his 
he leads counselors away stripped he makes judges fools 
he loosens the bond of kings he binds their waist with a belt 
he leads priests away stripped and overthrows the mighty 
he removes the speech of those who are trusted and takes away the understanding of the elders 
he pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong 
he uncovers deep things out of darkness and brings out to light the shadow of death 
he increases the nations and he destroys them he enlarges the nations and he leads them captive 
he takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way 
they grope in the dark without light he makes them stagger like a drunken man 
 behold my eye has seen all this my ear has heard and understood it 
what you know i know also i am not inferior to you 
 surely i would speak to the almighty i desire to reason with god 
but you are forgers of lies you are all physicians of no value 
oh that you would be completely silent ! then you would be wise 
hear now my reasoning listen to the pleadings of my lips 
will you speak unrighteously for god and talk deceitfully for him ?
will you show partiality to him ? will you contend for god ?
is it good that he should search you out ? or as one deceives a man will you deceive him ?
he will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality 
shall not his majesty make you afraid and his dread fall on you ?
your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes your defenses are defenses of clay 
 be silent leave me alone that i may speak let come on me what will 
why should i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand ?
behold he will kill me i have no hope nevertheless i will maintain my ways before him 
this also shall be my salvation that a godless man shall not come before him 
hear diligently my speech let my declaration be in your ears 
see now i have set my cause in order i know that i am righteous 
who is he who will contend with me ? for then would i hold my peace and give up the spirit 
 only don t do two things to me then i will not hide myself from your face 
withdraw your hand far from me and don t let your terror make me afraid 
then call and i will answer or let me speak and you answer me 
how many are my iniquities and sins ? make me know my disobedience and my sin 
why hide you your face and hold me for your enemy ?
will you harass a driven leaf ? will you pursue the dry stubble ?
for you write bitter things against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth 
you also put my feet in the stocks and mark all my paths you set a bound to the soles of my feet 
though i am decaying like a rotten thing like a garment that is moth eaten 
 man who is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble 
he comes forth like a flower and is cut down he also flees like a shadow and doesn t continue 
do you open your eyes on such a one and bring me into judgment with you ?
who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? not one 
seeing his days are determined the number of his months is with you and you have appointed his bounds that he can t pass 
look away from him that he may rest until he shall accomplish as a hireling his day 
 for there is hope for a tree if it is cut down that it will sprout again that the tender branch of it will not cease 
though its root grows old in the earth and its stock dies in the ground 
yet through the scent of water it will bud and put forth boughs like a plant 
but man dies and is laid low yes man gives up the spirit and where is he ?
as the waters fail from the sea and the river wastes and dries up 
so man lies down and doesn t rise until the heavens are no more they shall not awake nor be roused out of their sleep 
 oh that you would hide me in sheol that you would keep me secret until your wrath is past that you would appoint me a set time and remember me !
if a man dies shall he live again ? all the days of my warfare would i wait until my release should come 
you would call and i would answer you you would have a desire to the work of your hands 
but now you number my steps don t you watch over my sin ?
my disobedience is sealed up in a bag you fasten up my iniquity 
 but the mountain falling comes to nothing the rock is removed out of its place 
the waters wear the stones the torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth so you destroy the hope of man 
you forever prevail against him and he departs you change his face and send him away 
his sons come to honor and he doesn t know it they are brought low but he doesn t perceive it of them 
but his flesh on him has pain and his soul within him mourns 
then eliphaz the temanite answered 
 should a wise man answer with vain knowledge and fill himself with the east wind ?
should he reason with unprofitable talk or with speeches with which he can do no good ?
yes you do away with fear and hinder devotion before god 
for your iniquity teaches your mouth and you choose the language of the crafty 
your own mouth condemns you and not i yes your own lips testify against you 
 are you the first man who was born ? or were you brought forth before the hills ?
have you heard the secret counsel of god ? do you limit wisdom to yourself ?
what do you know that we don t know ? what do you understand which is not in us ?
with us are both the gray headed and the very aged men much elder than your father 
are the consolations of god too small for you even the word that is gentle toward you ?
why does your heart carry you away ? why do your eyes flash 
that you turn your spirit against god and let such words go out of your mouth ?
what is man that he should be clean ? what is he who is born of a woman that he should be righteous ?
behold he puts no trust in his holy ones yes the heavens are not clean in his sight 
how much less one who is abominable and corrupt a man who drinks iniquity like water !
 i will show you listen to me that which i have seen i will declare 
 which wise men have told by their fathers and have not hidden it 
to whom alone the land was given and no stranger passed among them 
the wicked man writhes in pain all his days even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor 
a sound of terrors is in his ears in prosperity the destroyer shall come on him 
he doesn t believe that he shall return out of darkness he is waited for by the sword 
he wanders abroad for bread saying where is it ? he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand 
distress and anguish make him afraid they prevail against him as a king ready to the battle 
because he has stretched out his hand against god and behaves himself proudly against the almighty 
he runs at him with a stiff neck with the thick shields of his bucklers 
because he has covered his face with his fatness and gathered fat on his thighs 
he has lived in desolate cities in houses which no one inhabited which were ready to become heaps 
he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth 
he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his branches by the breath of god s mouth shall he go away 
let him not trust in emptiness deceiving himself for emptiness shall be his reward 
it shall be accomplished before his time his branch shall not be green 
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree 
for the company of the godless shall be barren and fire shall consume the tents of bribery 
they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity their heart prepares deceit 
then job answered 
 i have heard many such things you are all miserable comforters !
shall vain words have an end ? or what provokes you that you answer ?
i also could speak as you do if your soul were in my soul s place i could join words together against you and shake my head at you 
but i would strengthen you with my mouth the solace of my lips would relieve you 
 though i speak my grief is not subsided though i forbear what am i eased ?
but now god you have surely worn me out you have made desolate all my company 
you have shriveled me up this is a witness against me my leanness rises up against me it testifies to my face 
he has torn me in his wrath and persecuted me he has gnashed on me with his teeth my adversary sharpens his eyes on me 
they have gaped on me with their mouth they have struck me on the cheek reproachfully they gather themselves together against me 
god delivers me to the ungodly and casts me into the hands of the wicked 
i was at ease and he broke me apart yes he has taken me by the neck and dashed me to pieces he has also set me up for his target 
his archers surround me he splits my kidneys apart and does not spare he pours out my gall on the ground 
he breaks me with breach on breach he runs on me like a giant 
i have sewed sackcloth on my skin and have thrust my horn in the dust 
my face is red with weeping deep darkness is on my eyelids 
although there is no violence in my hands and my prayer is pure 
 earth don t cover my blood let my cry have no place to rest 
even now behold my witness is in heaven he who vouches for me is on high 
my friends scoff at me my eyes pour out tears to god 
that he would maintain the right of a man with god of a son of man with his neighbor !
for when a few years have come i shall go the way of no return 
 my spirit is consumed my days are extinct and the grave is ready for me 
surely there are mockers with me my eye dwells on their provocation 
 now give a pledge be collateral for me with yourself who is there who will strike hands with me ?
for you have hidden their heart from understanding therefore you shall not exalt them 
he who denounces his friends for a prey even the eyes of his children shall fail 
 but he has made me a byword of the people they spit in my face 
my eye also is dim by reason of sorrow all my members are as a shadow 
upright men shall be astonished at this the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless 
yet shall the righteous hold on his way he who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger 
but as for you all come on now again i shall not find a wise man among you 
my days are past my plans are broken off as are the thoughts of my heart 
they change the night into day saying the light is near in the presence of darkness 
if i look for sheol as my house if i have spread my couch in the darkness 
if i have said to corruption you are my father to the worm my mother and my sister 
where then is my hope ? as for my hope who shall see it ?
shall it go down with me to the gates of sheol or descend together into the dust ? 
then bildad the shuhite answered 
 how long will you hunt for words ? consider and afterwards we will speak 
why are we counted as animals which have become unclean in your sight ?
you who tear yourself in your anger shall the earth be forsaken for you ? or shall the rock be removed out of its place ?
 yes the light of the wicked shall be put out the spark of his fire shall not shine 
the light shall be dark in his tent his lamp above him shall be put out 
the steps of his strength shall be shortened his own counsel shall cast him down 
for he is cast into a net by his own feet and he wanders into its mesh 
a snare will take him by the heel a trap will catch him 
a noose is hidden for him in the ground a trap for him in the way 
terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall chase him at his heels 
his strength shall be famished calamity shall be ready at his side 
the members of his body shall be devoured the firstborn of death shall devour his members 
he shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts he shall be brought to the king of terrors 
there shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation 
his roots shall be dried up beneath above shall his branch be cut off 
his memory shall perish from the earth he shall have no name in the street 
he shall be driven from light into darkness and chased out of the world 
he shall have neither son nor grandson among his people nor any remaining where he lived 
those who come after shall be astonished at his day as those who went before were frightened 
surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous this is the place of him who doesn t know god 
then job answered 
 how long will you torment me and crush me with words ?
you have reproached me ten times you aren t ashamed that you attack me 
if it is true that i have erred my error remains with myself 
if indeed you will magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach 
know now that god has subverted me and has surrounded me with his net 
 behold i cry out of wrong but i am not heard i cry for help but there is no justice 
he has walled up my way so that i can t pass and has set darkness in my paths 
he has stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head 
he has broken me down on every side and i am gone my hope he has plucked up like a tree 
he has also kindled his wrath against me he counts me among his adversaries 
his troops come on together build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent 
 he has put my brothers far from me my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me 
my relatives have gone away my familiar friends have forgotten me 
those who dwell in my house and my maids count me for a stranger i am an alien in their sight 
i call to my servant and he gives me no answer i beg him with my mouth 
my breath is offensive to my wife i am loathsome to the children of my own mother 
even young children despise me if i arise they speak against me 
all my familiar friends abhor me they whom i loved have turned against me 
my bones stick to my skin and to my flesh i have escaped by the skin of my teeth 
 have pity on me have pity on me you my friends for the hand of god has touched me 
why do you persecute me as god and are not satisfied with my flesh ?
 oh that my words were now written ! oh that they were inscribed in a book !
that with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever !
but as for me i know that my redeemer lives in the end he will stand upon the earth 
after my skin is destroyed then in my flesh shall i see god 
whom i even i shall see on my side my eyes shall see and not as a stranger my heart is consumed within me 
if you say how we will persecute him ! because the root of the matter is found in me 
be afraid of the sword for wrath brings the punishments of the sword that you may know there is a judgment 
then zophar the naamathite answered 
 therefore do my thoughts give answer to me even by reason of my haste that is in me 
i have heard the reproof which puts me to shame the spirit of my understanding answers me 
though his height mount up to the heavens and his head reach to the clouds 
yet he shall perish forever like his own dung those who have seen him shall say where is he ? 
he shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found yes he shall be chased away like a vision of the night 
the eye which saw him shall see him no more neither shall his place any more see him 
his children shall seek the favor of the poor his hands shall give back his wealth 
his bones are full of his youth but youth shall lie down with him in the dust 
 though wickedness is sweet in his mouth though he hide it under his tongue 
though he spare it and will not let it go but keep it still within his mouth 
yet his food in his bowels is turned it is cobra venom within him 
he has swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again god will cast them out of his belly 
he shall suck cobra venom the viper s tongue shall kill him 
he shall not look at the rivers the flowing streams of honey and butter 
that for which he labored he shall restore and shall not swallow it down according to the substance that he has gotten he shall not rejoice 
for he has oppressed and forsaken the poor he has violently taken away a house and he shall not build it up 
 because he knew no quietness within him he shall not save anything of that in which he delights 
there was nothing left that he didn t devour therefore his prosperity shall not endure 
in the fullness of his sufficiency distress shall overtake him the hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him 
when he is about to fill his belly god will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him it will rain on him while he is eating 
he shall flee from the iron weapon the bronze arrow shall strike him through 
he draws it forth and it comes out of his body yes the glittering point comes out of his liver terrors are on him 
all darkness is laid up for his treasures an unfanned fire shall devour him it shall consume that which is left in his tent 
the heavens shall reveal his iniquity the earth shall rise up against him 
the increase of his house shall depart they shall rush away in the day of his wrath 
this is the portion of a wicked man from god the heritage appointed to him by god 
then job answered 
 listen diligently to my speech let this be your consolation 
allow me and i also will speak after i have spoken mock on 
as for me is my complaint to man ? why shouldn t i be impatient ?
look at me and be astonished lay your hand on your mouth 
when i remember i am troubled horror takes hold of my flesh 
 why do the wicked live become old yes and grow mighty in power ?
their child is established with them in their sight their offspring before their eyes 
their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon them 
their bulls breed without fail their cows calve and don t miscarry 
they send forth their little ones like a flock their children dance 
they sing to the tambourine and harp and rejoice at the sound of the pipe 
they spend their days in prosperity in an instant they go down to sheol 
they tell god depart from us for we don t want to know about your ways 
what is the almighty that we should serve him ? what profit should we have if we pray to him ? 
behold their prosperity is not in their hand the counsel of the wicked is far from me 
 how often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out that their calamity comes on them that god distributes sorrows in his anger ?
how often is it that they are as stubble before the wind as chaff that the storm carries away ?
you say god lays up his iniquity for his children let him recompense it to himself that he may know it 
let his own eyes see his destruction let him drink of the wrath of the almighty 
for what does he care for his house after him when the number of his months is cut off ?
 shall any teach god knowledge since he judges those who are high ?
one dies in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet 
his pails are full of milk the marrow of his bones is moistened 
another dies in bitterness of soul and never tastes of good 
they lie down alike in the dust the worm covers them 
 behold i know your thoughts the devices with which you would wrong me 
for you say where is the house of the prince ? where is the tent in which the wicked lived ? 
haven t you asked wayfaring men ? don t you know their evidences 
that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity that they are led forth to the day of wrath ?
who shall declare his way to his face ? who shall repay him what he has done ?
yet he will be borne to the grave men shall keep watch over the tomb 
the clods of the valley shall be sweet to him all men shall draw after him as there were innumerable before him 
so how can you comfort me with nonsense because in your answers there remains only falsehood ? 
then eliphaz the temanite answered 
 can a man be profitable to god ? surely he who is wise is profitable to himself 
is it any pleasure to the almighty that you are righteous ? or does it benefit him that you make your ways perfect ?
is it for your piety that he reproves you that he enters with you into judgment ?
isn t your wickedness great ? neither is there any end to your iniquities 
for you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing and stripped the naked of their clothing 
you haven t given water to the weary to drink and you have withheld bread from the hungry 
but as for the mighty man he had the earth the honorable man he lived in it 
you have sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless have been broken 
therefore snares are around you sudden fear troubles you 
or darkness so that you can not see and floods of waters cover you 
 isn t god in the heights of heaven ? see the height of the stars how high they are !
you say what does god know ? can he judge through the thick darkness ?
thick clouds are a covering to him so that he doesn t see he walks on the vault of the sky 
will you keep the old way which wicked men have trodden 
who were snatched away before their time whose foundation was poured out as a stream 
who said to god depart from us and what can the almighty do for us ? 
yet he filled their houses with good things but the counsel of the wicked is far from me 
the righteous see it and are glad the innocent ridicule them 
saying surely those who rose up against us are cut off the fire has consumed their remnant 
 acquaint yourself with him now and be at peace thereby good shall come to you 
please receive instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart 
if you return to the almighty you shall be built up if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents 
lay your treasure in the dust the gold of ophir among the stones of the brooks 
the almighty will be your treasure and precious silver to you 
for then you will delight yourself in the almighty and shall lift up your face to god 
you shall make your prayer to him and he will hear you you shall pay your vows 
you shall also decree a thing and it shall be established to you light shall shine on your ways 
when they cast down you shall say be lifted up he will save the humble person 
he will even deliver him who is not innocent yes he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands 
then job answered 
 even today my complaint is rebellious his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning 
oh that i knew where i might find him ! that i might come even to his seat !
i would set my cause in order before him and fill my mouth with arguments 
i would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would tell me 
would he contend with me in the greatness of his power ? no but he would listen to me 
there the upright might reason with him so i should be delivered forever from my judge 
 if i go east he is not there if west i can t find him 
he works to the north but i can t see him he turns south but i can t catch a glimpse of him 
but he knows the way that i take when he has tried me i shall come forth like gold 
my foot has held fast to his steps i have kept his way and not turned aside 
i haven t gone back from the commandment of his lips i have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food 
but he stands alone and who can oppose him ? what his soul desires even that he does 
for he performs that which is appointed for me many such things are with him 
therefore i am terrified at his presence when i consider i am afraid of him 
for god has made my heart faint the almighty has terrified me 
because i was not cut off before the darkness neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face 
 why aren t times laid up by the almighty ? why don t those who know him see his days ?
there are people who remove the landmarks they violently take away flocks and feed them 
they drive away the donkey of the fatherless and they take the widow s ox for a pledge 
they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth all hide themselves 
behold as wild donkeys in the desert they go forth to their work seeking diligently for food the wilderness yields them bread for their children 
they cut their provender in the field they glean the vineyard of the wicked 
they lie all night naked without clothing and have no covering in the cold 
they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter 
there are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge of the poor 
so that they go around naked without clothing being hungry they carry the sheaves 
they make oil within the walls of these men they tread wine presses and suffer thirst 
from out of the populous city men groan the soul of the wounded cries out yet god doesn t regard the folly 
 these are of those who rebel against the light they don t know its ways nor stay in its paths 
the murderer rises with the light he kills the poor and needy in the night he is like a thief 
the eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight saying no eye shall see me he disguises his face 
in the dark they dig through houses they shut themselves up in the daytime they don t know the light 
for the morning is to all of them like thick darkness for they know the terrors of the thick darkness 
 they are foam on the surface of the waters their portion is cursed in the earth they don t turn into the way of the vineyards 
drought and heat consume the snow waters so does sheol those who have sinned 
the womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on him he shall be no more remembered unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree 
he devours the barren who don t bear he shows no kindness to the widow 
yet god preserves the mighty by his power he rises up who has no assurance of life 
god gives them security and they rest in it his eyes are on their ways 
they are exalted yet a little while and they are gone yes they are brought low they are taken out of the way as all others and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain 
if it isn t so now who will prove me a liar and make my speech worth nothing ? 
then bildad the shuhite answered 
 dominion and fear are with him he makes peace in his high places 
can his armies be counted ? on whom does his light not arise ?
how then can man be just with god ? or how can he who is born of a woman be clean ?
behold even the moon has no brightness and the stars are not pure in his sight 
how much less man who is a worm the son of man who is a worm ! 
then job answered 
 how have you helped him who is without power ! how have you saved the arm that has no strength !
how have you counseled him who has no wisdom and plentifully declared sound knowledge !
to whom have you uttered words ? whose spirit came forth from you ?
 those who are deceased tremble those beneath the waters and all that live in them 
sheol is naked before god and abaddon has no covering 
he stretches out the north over empty space and hangs the earth on nothing 
he binds up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is not burst under them 
he encloses the face of his throne and spreads his cloud on it 
he has described a boundary on the surface of the waters and to the confines of light and darkness 
the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke 
he stirs up the sea with his power and by his understanding he strikes through rahab 
by his spirit the heavens are garnished his hand has pierced the swift serpent 
behold these are but the outskirts of his ways how small a whisper do we hear of him ! but the thunder of his power who can understand ? 
job again took up his parable and said 
 as god lives who has taken away my right the almighty who has made my soul bitter 
 for the length of my life is still in me and the spirit of god is in my nostrils 
surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness neither shall my tongue utter deceit 
far be it from me that i should justify you until i die i will not put away my integrity from me 
i hold fast to my righteousness and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me so long as i live 
 let my enemy be as the wicked let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous 
for what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off when god takes away his life ?
will god hear his cry when trouble comes on him ?
will he delight himself in the almighty and call on god at all times ?
i will teach you about the hand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal 
behold all of you have seen it yourselves why then have you become altogether vain ?
 this is the portion of a wicked man with god the heritage of oppressors which they receive from the almighty 
if his children are multiplied it is for the sword his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread 
those who remain of him shall be buried in death his widows shall make no lamentation 
though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare clothing as the clay 
he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silver 
he builds his house as the moth as a booth which the watchman makes 
he lies down rich but he shall not do so again he opens his eyes and he is not 
terrors overtake him like waters a storm steals him away in the night 
the east wind carries him away and he departs it sweeps him out of his place 
for it hurls at him and does not spare as he flees away from his hand 
men shall clap their hands at him and shall hiss him out of his place 
 surely there is a mine for silver and a place for gold which they refine 
iron is taken out of the earth and copper is smelted out of the ore 
man sets an end to darkness and searches out to the furthest bound the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness 
he breaks open a shaft away from where people live they are forgotten by the foot they hang far from men they swing back and forth 
as for the earth out of it comes bread underneath it is turned up as it were by fire 
sapphires come from its rocks it has dust of gold 
that path no bird of prey knows neither has the falcon s eye seen it 
the proud animals have not trodden it nor has the fierce lion passed by there 
he puts forth his hand on the flinty rock and he overturns the mountains by the roots 
he cuts out channels among the rocks his eye sees every precious thing 
he binds the streams that they don t trickle the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light 
 but where shall wisdom be found ? where is the place of understanding ?
man doesn t know its price neither is it found in the land of the living 
the deep says it isn t in me the sea says it isn t with me 
it can t be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed for its price 
it can t be valued with the gold of ophir with the precious onyx or the sapphire 
gold and glass can t equal it neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold 
no mention shall be made of coral or of crystal yes the price of wisdom is above rubies 
the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be valued with pure gold 
where then does wisdom come from ? where is the place of understanding ?
seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living and kept close from the birds of the sky 
destruction and death say we have heard a rumor of it with our ears 
 god understands its way and he knows its place 
for he looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole sky 
he establishes the force of the wind yes he measures out the waters by measure 
when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder 
then he saw it and declared it he established it yes and searched it out 
to man he said behold the fear of the lord that is wisdom to depart from evil is understanding 
job again took up his parable and said 
 oh that i were as in the months of old as in the days when god watched over me 
when his lamp shone on my head and by his light i walked through darkness 
as i was in the ripeness of my days when the friendship of god was in my tent 
when the almighty was yet with me and my children were around me 
when my steps were washed with butter and the rock poured out streams of oil for me 
when i went forth to the city gate when i prepared my seat in the street 
the young men saw me and hid themselves the aged rose up and stood 
the princes refrained from talking and laid their hand on their mouth 
the voice of the nobles was hushed and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth 
for when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it commended me 
because i delivered the poor who cried and the fatherless also who had none to help him 
the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me and i caused the widow s heart to sing for joy 
i put on righteousness and it clothed me my justice was as a robe and a diadem 
i was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame 
i was a father to the needy the cause of him who i didn t know i searched out 
i broke the jaws of the unrighteous and plucked the prey out of his teeth 
then i said i shall die in my own house i shall number my days as the sand 
my root is spread out to the waters the dew lies all night on my branch 
my glory is fresh in me my bow is renewed in my hand 
 men listened to me waited and kept silence for my counsel 
after my words they didn t speak again my speech fell on them 
they waited for me as for the rain their mouths drank as with the spring rain 
i smiled on them when they had no confidence they didn t reject the light of my face 
i chose out their way and sat as chief i lived as a king in the army as one who comforts the mourners 
 but now those who are younger than i have me in derision whose fathers i would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs 
of what use is the strength of their hands to me men in whom ripe age has perished ?
they are gaunt from lack and famine they gnaw the dry ground in the gloom of waste and desolation 
they pluck salt herbs by the bushes the roots of the broom are their food 
they are driven out from the midst of men they cry after them as after a thief 
so that they dwell in frightful valleys and in holes of the earth and of the rocks 
among the bushes they bray and under the nettles they are gathered together 
they are children of fools yes children of base men they were flogged out of the land 
 now i have become their song yes i am a byword to them 
they abhor me they stand aloof from me and don t hesitate to spit in my face 
for he has untied his cord and afflicted me and they have thrown off restraint before me 
on my right hand rise the rabble they thrust aside my feet they cast up against me their ways of destruction 
they mar my path they set forward my calamity without anyone s help 
as through a wide breach they come in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in 
terrors have turned on me they chase my honor as the wind my welfare has passed away as a cloud 
 now my soul is poured out within me days of affliction have taken hold on me 
in the night season my bones are pierced in me and the pains that gnaw me take no rest 
by great force is my garment disfigured it binds me about as the collar of my coat 
he has cast me into the mire i have become like dust and ashes 
i cry to you and you do not answer me i stand up and you gaze at me 
you have turned to be cruel to me with the might of your hand you persecute me 
you lift me up to the wind and drive me with it you dissolve me in the storm 
for i know that you will bring me to death to the house appointed for all living 
 however doesn t one stretch out a hand in his fall ? or in his calamity therefore cry for help ?
didn t i weep for him who was in trouble ? wasn t my soul grieved for the needy ?
when i looked for good then evil came when i waited for light there came darkness 
my heart is troubled and doesn t rest days of affliction have come on me 
i go mourning without the sun i stand up in the assembly and cry for help 
i am a brother to jackals and a companion to ostriches 
my skin grows black and peels from me my bones are burned with heat 
therefore my harp has turned to mourning and my pipe into the voice of those who weep 
 i made a covenant with my eyes how then should i look lustfully at a young woman ?
for what is the portion from god above and the heritage from the almighty on high ?
is it not calamity to the unrighteous and disaster to the workers of iniquity ?
doesn t he see my ways and number all my steps ?
 if i have walked with falsehood and my foot has hurried to deceit
 let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know my integrity 
if my step has turned out of the way if my heart walked after my eyes if any defilement has stuck to my hands 
then let me sow and let another eat yes let the produce of my field be rooted out 
 if my heart has been enticed to a woman and i have laid wait at my neighbor s door 
then let my wife grind for another and let others sleep with her 
for that would be a heinous crime yes it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges 
for it is a fire that consumes to destruction and would root out all my increase 
 if i have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant when they contended with me 
what then shall i do when god rises up ? when he visits what shall i answer him ?
didn t he who made me in the womb make him ? didn t one fashion us in the womb ?
 if i have withheld the poor from their desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail 
or have eaten my morsel alone and the fatherless has not eaten of it
 no from my youth he grew up with me as with a father her have i guided from my mother s womb 
if i have seen any perish for want of clothing or that the needy had no covering 
if his heart hasn t blessed me if he hasn t been warmed with my sheep s fleece 
if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless because i saw my help in the gate 
then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade and my arm be broken from the bone 
for calamity from god is a terror to me because his majesty i can do nothing 
 if i have made gold my hope and have said to the fine gold you are my confidence 
if i have rejoiced because my wealth was great and because my hand had gotten much 
if i have seen the sun when it shined or the moon moving in splendor 
and my heart has been secretly enticed and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth 
this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges for i should have denied the god who is above 
 if i have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me or lifted up myself when evil found him 
 yes i have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse 
if the men of my tent have not said who can find one who has not been filled with his meat ? 
 the foreigner has not lodged in the street but i have opened my doors to the traveler 
if like adam i have covered my transgressions by hiding my iniquity in my heart 
because i feared the great multitude and the contempt of families terrified me so that i kept silence and didn t go out of the door 
oh that i had one to hear me ! behold here is my signature let the almighty answer me let the accuser write my indictment !
surely i would carry it on my shoulder and i would bind it to me as a crown 
i would declare to him the number of my steps as a prince would i go near to him 
if my land cries out against me and its furrows weep together 
if i have eaten its fruits without money or have caused its owners to lose their life 
let briars grow instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley the words of job are ended 
so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes 
then the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzite of the family of ram was kindled against job his wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than god 
also his wrath was kindled against his three friends because they had found no answer and yet had condemned job 
now elihu had waited to speak to job because they were elder than he 
when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men his wrath was kindled 
elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered i am young and you are very old therefore i held back and didn t dare show you my opinion 
i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom 
but there is a spirit in man and the breath of the almighty gives them understanding 
it is not the great who are wise nor the aged who understand justice 
therefore i said listen to me i also will show my opinion 
 behold i waited for your words and i listened for your reasoning while you searched out what to say 
yes i gave you my full attention but there was no one who convinced job or who answered his words among you 
beware lest you say we have found wisdom god may refute him not man 
for he has not directed his words against me neither will i answer him with your speeches 
 they are amazed they answer no more they don t have a word to say 
shall i wait because they don t speak because they stand still and answer no more ?
i also will answer my part and i also will show my opinion 
for i am full of words the spirit within me constrains me 
behold my breast is as wine which has no vent like new wineskins it is ready to burst 
i will speak that i may be refreshed i will open my lips and answer 
please don t let me respect any man s person neither will i give flattering titles to any man 
for i don t know how to give flattering titles or else my maker would soon take me away 
 however job please hear my speech and listen to all my words 
see now i have opened my mouth my tongue has spoken in my mouth 
my words shall utter the uprightness of my heart that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely 
the spirit of god has made me and the breath of the almighty gives me life 
if you can answer me set your words in order before me and stand forth 
behold i am toward god even as you are i am also formed out of the clay 
behold my terror shall not make you afraid neither shall my pressure be heavy on you 
 surely you have spoken in my hearing i have heard the voice of your words saying 
 i am clean without disobedience i am innocent neither is there iniquity in me 
behold he finds occasions against me he counts me for his enemy 
he puts my feet in the stocks he marks all my paths 
 behold i will answer you in this you are not just for god is greater than man 
why do you strive against him because he doesn t give account of any of his matters ?
for god speaks once yes twice though man pays no attention 
in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falls on men in slumbering on the bed 
then he opens the ears of men and seals their instruction 
that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide pride from man 
he keeps back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword 
he is chastened also with pain on his bed with continual strife in his bones 
so that his life abhors bread and his soul dainty food 
his flesh is so consumed away that it can t be seen his bones that were not seen stick out 
yes his soul draws near to the pit and his life to the destroyers 
 if there is beside him an angel an interpreter one among a thousand to show to man what is right for him 
then god is gracious to him and says deliver him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom 
his flesh shall be fresher than a child s he returns to the days of his youth 
he prays to god and he is favorable to him so that he sees his face with joy he restores to man his righteousness 
he sings before men and says i have sinned and perverted that which was right and it didn t profit me 
he has redeemed my soul from going into the pit my life shall see the light 
 behold god works all these things twice yes three times with a man 
to bring back his soul from the pit that he may be enlightened with the light of the living 
mark well job and listen to me hold your peace and i will speak 
if you have anything to say answer me speak for i desire to justify you 
if not listen to me hold your peace and i will teach you wisdom 
moreover elihu answered 
 hear my words you wise men give ear to me you who have knowledge 
for the ear tries words as the palate tastes food 
let us choose for us that which is right let us know among ourselves what is good 
for job has said i am righteous god has taken away my right 
notwithstanding my right i am considered a liar my wound is incurable though i am without disobedience 
what man is like job who drinks scorn like water 
who goes in company with the workers of iniquity and walks with wicked men ?
for he has said it profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with god 
 therefore listen to me you men of understanding far be it from god that he should do wickedness from the almighty that he should commit iniquity 
for the work of a man he will render to him and cause every man to find according to his ways 
yes surely god will not do wickedly neither will the almighty pervert justice 
who put him in charge of the earth ? or who has appointed him over the whole world ?
if he set his heart on himself if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath 
all flesh would perish together and man would turn again to dust 
 if now you have understanding hear this listen to the voice of my words 
shall even one who hates justice govern ? will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty ? 
who says to a king vile ! or to nobles wicked ! ?
who doesn t respect the persons of princes nor respects the rich more than the poor for they all are the work of his hands 
in a moment they die even at midnight the people are shaken and pass away the mighty are taken away without a hand 
 for his eyes are on the ways of a man he sees all his goings 
there is no darkness nor thick gloom where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves 
for he doesn t need to consider a man further that he should go before god in judgment 
he breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out and sets others in their place 
therefore he takes knowledge of their works he overturns them in the night so that they are destroyed 
he strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others 
because they turned aside from following him and wouldn t pay attention to any of his ways 
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him he heard the cry of the afflicted 
when he gives quietness who then can condemn ? when he hides his face who then can see him ? alike whether to a nation or to a man 
that the godless man may not reign that there be no one to ensnare the people 
 for has any said to god i am guilty but i will not offend any more 
teach me that which i don t see if i have done iniquity i will do it no more ?
shall his recompense be as you desire that you refuse it ? for you must choose and not i therefore speak what you know 
men of understanding will tell me yes every wise man who hears me 
 job speaks without knowledge his words are without wisdom 
i wish that job were tried to the end because of his answering like wicked men 
for he adds rebellion to his sin he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against god 
moreover elihu answered 
 do you think this to be your right or do you say my righteousness is more than god s 
that you ask what advantage will it be to you ? what profit shall i have more than if i had sinned ? 
i will answer you and your companions with you 
look to the heavens and see see the skies which are higher than you 
if you have sinned what effect do you have against him ? if your transgressions are multiplied what do you do to him ?
if you are righteous what do you give him ? or what does he receive from your hand ?
your wickedness may hurt a man as you are and your righteousness may profit a son of man 
 by reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty 
but none says where is god my maker who gives songs in the night 
who teaches us more than the animals of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky ? 
there they cry but none gives answer because of the pride of evil men 
surely god will not hear an empty cry neither will the almighty regard it 
how much less when you say you don t see him the cause is before him and you wait for him !
but now because he has not visited in his anger neither does he greatly regard arrogance 
therefore job opens his mouth with empty talk and he multiplies words without knowledge 
elihu also continued and said 
 bear with me a little and i will show you for i still have something to say on god s behalf 
i will get my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my maker 
for truly my words are not false one who is perfect in knowledge is with you 
 behold god is mighty and doesn t despise anyone he is mighty in strength of understanding 
he doesn t preserve the life of the wicked but gives to the afflicted their right 
he doesn t withdraw his eyes from the righteous but with kings on the throne he sets them forever and they are exalted 
he also opens their ears to instruction and commands that they return from iniquity 
if they listen and serve him they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasures 
but if they don t listen they shall perish by the sword they shall die without knowledge 
 but those who are godless in heart lay up anger they don t cry for help when he binds them 
they die in youth their life perishes among the unclean 
he delivers the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ear in oppression 
yes he would have allured you out of distress into a broad place where there is no restriction that which is set on your table would be full of fatness 
 but you are full of the judgment of the wicked judgment and justice take hold of you 
don t let riches entice you to wrath neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside 
would your wealth sustain you in distress or all the might of your strength ?
don t desire the night when people are cut off in their place 
take heed don t regard iniquity for you have chosen this rather than affliction 
behold god is exalted in his power who is a teacher like him ?
who has prescribed his way for him ? or who can say you have committed unrighteousness ? 
 remember that you magnify his work whereof men have sung 
all men have looked thereon man sees it afar off 
behold god is great and we don t know him the number of his years is unsearchable 
for he draws up the drops of water which distill in rain from his vapor 
which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly 
yes can any understand the spreading of the clouds and the thunderings of his pavilion ?
behold he spreads his light around him he covers the bottom of the sea 
for by these he judges the people he gives food in abundance 
he covers his hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark 
its noise tells about him and the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up 
 yes at this my heart trembles and is moved out of its place 
hear oh hear the noise of his voice the sound that goes out of his mouth 
he sends it forth under the whole sky and his lightning to the ends of the earth 
after it a voice roars he thunders with the voice of his majesty he doesn t hold back anything when his voice is heard 
god thunders marvelously with his voice he does great things which we can t comprehend 
for he says to the snow fall on the earth likewise to the shower of rain and to the showers of his mighty rain 
he seals up the hand of every man that all men whom he has made may know it 
then the animals take cover and remain in their dens 
out of its room comes the storm and cold out of the north 
by the breath of god ice is given and the breadth of the waters is frozen 
yes he loads the thick cloud with moisture he spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning 
it is turned around by his guidance that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world 
whether it is for correction or for his land or for loving kindness that he causes it to come 
 listen to this job stand still and consider the wondrous works of god 
do you know how god controls them and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine ?
do you know the workings of the clouds the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge ?
you whose clothing is warm when the earth is still by reason of the south wind ?
can you with him spread out the sky which is strong as a cast metal mirror ?
teach us what we shall tell him for we can t make our case by reason of darkness 
shall it be told him that i would speak ? or should a man wish that he were swallowed up ?
now men don t see the light which is bright in the skies but the wind passes and clears them 
out of the north comes golden splendor with god is awesome majesty 
we can t reach the almighty he is exalted in power in justice and great righteousness he will not oppress 
therefore men revere him he doesn t regard any who are wise of heart 
then yahweh answered job out of the whirlwind 
 who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge ?
brace yourself like a man for i will question you then you answer me !
 where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth ? declare if you have understanding 
who determined its measures if you know ? or who stretched the line on it ?
whereupon were its foundations fastened ? or who laid its cornerstone 
when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy ?
 or who shut up the sea with doors when it broke forth from the womb 
when i made clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness 
marked out for it my bound set bars and doors 
and said here you may come but no further here your proud waves shall be stayed ? 
 have you commanded the morning in your days and caused the dawn to know its place 
that it might take hold of the ends of the earth and shake the wicked out of it ?
it is changed as clay under the seal and stands forth as a garment 
from the wicked their light is withheld the high arm is broken 
 have you entered into the springs of the sea ? or have you walked in the recesses of the deep ?
have the gates of death been revealed to you ? or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death ?
have you comprehended the earth in its breadth ? declare if you know it all 
 what is the way to the dwelling of light ? as for darkness where is its place 
that you should take it to its bound that you should discern the paths to its house ?
surely you know for you were born then and the number of your days is great !
have you entered the treasuries of the snow or have you seen the treasures of the hail 
which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war ?
by what way is the lightning distributed or the east wind scattered on the earth ?
who has cut a channel for the flood water or the path for the thunderstorm 
to cause it to rain on a land where no man is on the wilderness in which there is no man 
to satisfy the waste and desolate ground to cause the tender grass to spring forth ?
does the rain have a father ? or who fathers the drops of dew ?
out of whose womb came the ice ? the gray frost of the sky who has given birth to it ?
the waters become hard like stone when the surface of the deep is frozen 
 can you bind the cluster of the pleiades or loosen the cords of orion ?
can you lead forth the constellations in their season ? or can you guide the bear with her cubs ?
do you know the laws of the heavens ? can you establish its dominion over the earth ?
 can you lift up your voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may cover you ?
can you send forth lightnings that they may go ? do they report to you here we are ? 
who has put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who has given understanding to the mind ?
who can number the clouds by wisdom ? or who can pour out the bottles of the sky 
when the dust runs into a mass and the clods of earth stick together ?
 can you hunt the prey for the lioness or satisfy the appetite of the young lions 
when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait in the thicket ?
who provides for the raven his prey when his young ones cry to god and wander for lack of food ?
 do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth ? do you watch when the doe bears fawns ?
can you number the months that they fulfill ? or do you know the time when they give birth ?
they bow themselves they bring forth their young they end their labor pains 
their young ones become strong they grow up in the open field they go forth and don t return again 
 who has set the wild donkey free ? or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey 
whose home i have made the wilderness and the salt land his dwelling place ?
he scorns the tumult of the city neither does he hear the shouting of the driver 
the range of the mountains is his pasture he searches after every green thing 
 will the wild ox be content to serve you ? or will he stay by your feeding trough ?
can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness ? or will he till the valleys after you ?
will you trust him because his strength is great ? or will you leave to him your labor ?
will you confide in him that he will bring home your seed and gather the grain of your threshing floor ?
 the wings of the ostrich wave proudly but are they the feathers and plumage of love ?
for she leaves her eggs on the earth warms them in the dust 
and forgets that the foot may crush them or that the wild animal may trample them 
she deals harshly with her young ones as if they were not hers though her labor is in vain she is without fear 
because god has deprived her of wisdom neither has he imparted to her understanding 
when she lifts up herself on high she scorns the horse and his rider 
 have you given the horse might ? have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane ?
have you made him to leap as a locust ? the glory of his snorting is awesome 
he paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength he goes out to meet the armed men 
he mocks at fear and is not dismayed neither does he turn back from the sword 
the quiver rattles against him the flashing spear and the javelin 
he eats up the ground with fierceness and rage neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet 
as often as the trumpet sounds he snorts aha ! he smells the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting 
 is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars and stretches her wings toward the south ?
is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high ?
on the cliff he dwells and makes his home on the point of the cliff and the stronghold 
from there he spies out the prey his eyes see it afar off 
his young ones also suck up blood where the slain are there he is 
moreover yahweh answered job 
 shall he who argues contend with the almighty ? he who argues with god let him answer it 
then job answered yahweh 
 behold i am of small account what shall i answer you ? i lay my hand on my mouth 
i have spoken once and i will not answer yes twice but i will proceed no further 
then yahweh answered job out of the whirlwind 
 now brace yourself like a man i will question you and you will answer me 
will you even annul my judgment ? will you condemn me that you may be justified ?
or do you have an arm like god ? can you thunder with a voice like him ?
 now deck yourself with excellency and dignity array yourself with honor and majesty 
pour out the fury of your anger look at everyone who is proud and bring him low 
look at everyone who is proud and humble him crush the wicked in their place 
hide them in the dust together bind their faces in the hidden place 
then i will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you 
 see now behemoth which i made as well as you he eats grass as an ox 
look now his strength is in his thighs his force is in the muscles of his belly 
he moves his tail like a cedar the sinews of his thighs are knit together 
his bones are like tubes of brass his limbs are like bars of iron 
he is the chief of the ways of god he who made him gives him his sword 
surely the mountains produce food for him where all the animals of the field play 
he lies under the lotus trees in the covert of the reed and the marsh 
the lotuses cover him with their shade the willows of the brook surround him 
behold if a river overflows he doesn t tremble he is confident though the jordan swells even to his mouth 
shall any take him when he is on the watch or pierce through his nose with a snare ?
 can you draw out leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord ?
can you put a rope into his nose or pierce his jaw through with a hook ?
will he make many petitions to you or will he speak soft words to you ?
will he make a covenant with you that you should take him for a servant forever ?
will you play with him as with a bird ? or will you bind him for your girls ?
will traders barter for him ? will they part him among the merchants ?
can you fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears ?
lay your hand on him remember the battle and do so no more 
behold the hope of him is in vain won t one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
none is so fierce that he dare stir him up who then is he who can stand before me ?
who has first given to me that i should repay him ? everything under the heavens is mine 
 i will not keep silence concerning his limbs nor his mighty strength nor his goodly frame 
who can strip off his outer garment ? who shall come within his jaws ?
who can open the doors of his face ? around his teeth is terror 
strong scales are his pride shut up together with a close seal 
one is so near to another that no air can come between them 
they are joined one to another they stick together so that they can t be pulled apart 
his sneezing flashes out light his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning 
out of his mouth go burning torches sparks of fire leap forth 
out of his nostrils a smoke goes as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds 
his breath kindles coals a flame goes forth from his mouth 
there is strength in his neck terror dances before him 
the flakes of his flesh are joined together they are firm on him they can t be moved 
his heart is as firm as a stone yes firm as the lower millstone 
when he raises himself up the mighty are afraid they retreat before his thrashing 
if one attacks him with the sword it can t prevail nor the spear the dart nor the pointed shaft 
he counts iron as straw and brass as rotten wood 
the arrow can t make him flee sling stones are like chaff to him 
clubs are counted as stubble he laughs at the rushing of the javelin 
his undersides are like sharp potsherds leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge 
he makes the deep to boil like a pot he makes the sea like a pot of ointment 
he makes a path shine after him one would think the deep had white hair 
on earth there is not his equal that is made without fear 
he sees everything that is high he is king over all the sons of pride 
then job answered yahweh 
 i know that you can do all things and that no purpose of yours can be restrained 
you asked who is this who hides counsel without knowledge ? therefore i have uttered that which i did not understand things too wonderful for me which i didn t know 
you said listen now and i will speak i will question you and you will answer me 
i had heard of you by the hearing of the ear but now my eye sees you 
therefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes 
it was so that after yahweh had spoken these words to job yahweh said to eliphaz the temanite my wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job has 
now therefore take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for i will accept him that i not deal with you according to your folly for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job has 
so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went and did what yahweh commanded them and yahweh accepted job 
yahweh turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends yahweh gave job twice as much as he had before 
then came there to him all his brothers and all his sisters and all those who had been of his acquaintance before and ate bread with him in his house they comforted him and consoled him concerning all the evil that yahweh had brought on him everyone also gave him a piece of money and everyone a ring of gold 
so yahweh blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning he had fourteen thousand sheep six thousand camels one thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand female donkeys 
he had also seven sons and three daughters 
he called the name of the first jemimah and the name of the second keziah and the name of the third keren happuch 
in all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of job their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers 
after this job lived one hundred forty years and saw his sons and his sons sons to four generations 
so job died being old and full of days 
blessed is the man who doesn t walk in the counsel of the wicked nor stand in the way of sinners nor sit in the seat of scoffers 
but his delight is in yahweh s law on his law he meditates day and night 
he will be like a tree planted by the streams of water that brings forth its fruit in its season whose leaf also does not wither whatever he does shall prosper 
the wicked are not so but are like the chaff which the wind drives away 
therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous 
for yahweh knows the way of the righteous but the way of the wicked shall perish 
why do the nations rage and the peoples plot a vain thing ?
the kings of the earth take a stand and the rulers take counsel together against yahweh and against his anointed saying 
 let s break their bonds apart and cast their cords from us 
he who sits in the heavens will laugh the lord will have them in derision 
i will tell of the decree yahweh said to me you are my son today i have become your father 
ask of me and i will give the nations for your inheritance the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession 
you shall break them with a rod of iron you shall dash them in pieces like a potter s vessel 
now therefore be wise you kings be instructed you judges of the earth 
serve yahweh with fear and rejoice with trembling 
give sincere homage to the son lest he be angry and you perish in the way for his wrath will soon be kindled blessed are all those who take refuge in him 
 a psalm by david when he fled from absalom his son yahweh how my adversaries have increased ! many are those who rise up against me

but you yahweh are a shield around me my glory and the one who lifts up my head

offer the sacrifices of righteousness put your trust in yahweh 
many say who will show us any good ? yahweh let the light of your face shine on us 
you have put gladness in my heart more than when their grain and their new wine are increased

 for the chief musician with the flutes a psalm by david give ear to my words yahweh consider my meditation 
listen to the voice of my cry my king and my god for to you do i pray 
yahweh in the morning you shall hear my voice in the morning i will lay my requests before you and will watch expectantly 
for you are not a god who has pleasure in wickedness evil can t live with you 
the arrogant shall not stand in your sight you hate all workers of iniquity 
you will destroy those who speak lies yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man 
but as for me in the abundance of your loving kindness i will come into your house i will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you 
lead me yahweh in your righteousness because of my enemies make your way straight before my face 
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth their heart is destruction their throat is an open tomb they flatter with their tongue 
hold them guilty god let them fall by their own counsels thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions for they have rebelled against you 
but let all those who take refuge in you rejoice let them always shout for joy because you defend them let them also who love your name be joyful in you 
for you will bless the righteous yahweh you will surround him with favor as with a shield 
 for the chief musician on stringed instruments upon the eight stringed lyre a psalm by david yahweh don t rebuke me in your anger neither discipline me in your wrath 
have mercy on me yahweh for i am faint yahweh heal me for my bones are troubled 
my soul is also in great anguish but you yahweh how long ?
return yahweh deliver my soul and save me for your loving kindness sake 
for in death there is no memory of you in sheol who shall give you thanks ?
i am weary with my groaning every night i flood my bed i drench my couch with my tears 
my eye wastes away because of grief it grows old because of all my adversaries 
depart from me all you workers of iniquity for yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping 
yahweh has heard my supplication yahweh accepts my prayer 
may all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed they shall turn back they shall be disgraced suddenly 
 a meditation by david which he sang to yahweh concerning the words of cush the benjamite yahweh my god i take refuge in you save me from all those who pursue me and deliver me 
lest they tear apart my soul like a lion ripping it in pieces while there is none to deliver 
yahweh my god if i have done this if there is iniquity in my hands 
if i have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me yes if i have delivered him who without cause was my adversary 
let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it yes let him tread my life down to the earth and lay my glory in the dust selah 
arise yahweh in your anger lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries awake for me you have commanded judgment 
let the congregation of the peoples surround you rule over them on high 
yahweh administers judgment to the peoples judge me yahweh according to my righteousness and to my integrity that is in me 
oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end but establish the righteous their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous god 
my shield is with god who saves the upright in heart 
god is a righteous judge yes a god who has indignation every day 
if a man doesn t relent he will sharpen his sword he has bent and strung his bow 
he has also prepared for himself the instruments of death he makes ready his flaming arrows 
behold he travails with iniquity yes he has conceived mischief and brought forth falsehood 
he has dug a hole and has fallen into the pit which he made 
the trouble he causes shall return to his own head his violence shall come down on the crown of his own head 
i will give thanks to yahweh according to his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of yahweh most high 
 for the chief musician on an instrument of gath a psalm by david yahweh our lord how majestic is your name in all the earth who has set your glory above the heavens !
from the lips of babes and infants you have established strength because of your adversaries that you might silence the enemy and the avenger 
when i consider your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you have ordained 
what is man that you think of him ? what is the son of man that you care for him ?
for you have made him a little lower than god and crowned him with glory and honor 
you make him ruler over the works of your hands you have put all things under his feet 
all sheep and cattle yes and the animals of the field 
the birds of the sky the fish of the sea and whatever passes through the paths of the seas 
yahweh our lord how majestic is your name in all the earth !
 for the chief musician set to the death of the son a psalm by david i will give thanks to yahweh with my whole heart i will tell of all your marvelous works 
i will be glad and rejoice in you i will sing praise to your name o most high 
when my enemies turn back they stumble and perish in your presence 
for you have maintained my just cause you sit on the throne judging righteously 
you have rebuked the nations you have destroyed the wicked you have blotted out their name forever and ever 
the enemy is overtaken by endless ruin the very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished 
but yahweh reigns forever he has prepared his throne for judgment 
he will judge the world in righteousness he will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness 
yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed a high tower in times of trouble 
those who know your name will put their trust in you for you yahweh have not forsaken those who seek you 
sing praises to yahweh who dwells in zion and declare among the people what he has done 
for he who avenges blood remembers them he doesn t forget the cry of the afflicted 
have mercy on me yahweh see my affliction by those who hate me and lift me up from the gates of death 
that i may show forth all your praise in the gates of the daughter of zion i will rejoice in your salvation 
the nations have sunk down in the pit that they made in the net which they hid their own foot is taken 
yahweh has made himself known he has executed judgment the wicked is snared by the work of his own hands meditation selah 
the wicked shall be turned back to sheol even all the nations that forget god 
for the needy shall not always be forgotten nor the hope of the poor perish forever 
arise yahweh ! don t let man prevail let the nations be judged in your sight 
put them in fear yahweh let the nations know that they are only men selah 
why do you stand far off yahweh ? why do you hide yourself in times of trouble ?
in arrogance the wicked hunt down the weak they are caught in the schemes that they devise 
for the wicked boasts of his heart s cravings he blesses the greedy and condemns yahweh 
the wicked in the pride of his face has no room in his thoughts for god 
his ways are prosperous at all times he is haughty and your laws are far from his sight as for all his adversaries he sneers at them 
he says in his heart i shall not be shaken for generations i shall have no trouble 
his mouth is full of cursing deceit and oppression under his tongue is mischief and iniquity 
he lies in wait near the villages from ambushes he murders the innocent his eyes are secretly set against the helpless 
he lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush he lies in wait to catch the helpless he catches the helpless when he draws him in his net 
the helpless are crushed they collapse they fall under his strength 
he says in his heart god has forgotten he hides his face he will never see it 
arise yahweh ! god lift up your hand ! don t forget the helpless 
why does the wicked person condemn god and say in his heart god won t call me into account ? 
but you do see trouble and grief you consider it to take it into your hand you help the victim and the fatherless 
break the arm of the wicked as for the evil man seek out his wickedness until you find none 
yahweh is king forever and ever ! the nations will perish out of his land 
yahweh you have heard the desire of the humble you will prepare their heart you will cause your ear to hear 
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed that man who is of the earth may terrify no more 
 for the chief musician by david in yahweh i take refuge how can you say to my soul flee as a bird to your mountain ! 
for behold the wicked bend their bows they set their arrows on the strings that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart 
if the foundations are destroyed what can the righteous do ?
yahweh is in his holy temple yahweh is on his throne in heaven his eyes observe his eyes examine the children of men 
yahweh examines the righteous but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates 
on the wicked he will rain blazing coals fire sulfur and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup 
for yahweh is righteous he loves righteousness the upright shall see his face 
 for the chief musician upon an eight stringed lyre a psalm of david help yahweh for the godly man ceases for the faithful fail from among the children of men 
everyone lies to his neighbor they speak with flattering lips and with a double heart 
may yahweh cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that boasts 
who have said with our tongue we will prevail our lips are our own who is lord over us ? 
 because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy i will now arise says yahweh i will set him in safety from those who malign him 
the words of yahweh are flawless words as silver refined in a clay furnace purified seven times 
you will keep them yahweh you will preserve them from this generation forever 
the wicked walk on every side when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men 
 for the chief musician a psalm by david how long yahweh ? will you forget me forever ? how long will you hide your face from me ?
how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart every day ? how long shall my enemy triumph over me ?
behold and answer me yahweh my god give light to my eyes lest i sleep in death 
lest my enemy say i have prevailed against him lest my adversaries rejoice when i fall 
but i trust in your loving kindness my heart rejoices in your salvation 
i will sing to yahweh because he has been good to me 
 for the chief musician by david the fool has said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none who does good 
yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men to see if there were any who understood who sought after god 
they have all gone aside they have together become corrupt there is none who does good no not one 
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and don t call on yahweh ?
oh that the salvation of israel would come out of zion ! when yahweh restores the fortunes of his people then jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad 
 a psalm by david yahweh who shall dwell in your sanctuary ? who shall live on your holy hill ?
he who walks blamelessly does what is right and speaks truth in his heart 
he who doesn t slander with his tongue nor does evil to his friend nor casts slurs against his fellow man 
in whose eyes a vile man is despised but who honors those who fear yahweh he who keeps an oath even when it hurts and doesn t change 
he who doesn t lend out his money for usury nor take a bribe against the innocent he who does these things shall never be shaken 
 a poem by david preserve me god for in you do i take refuge 
my soul you have said to yahweh you are my lord apart from you i have no good thing 
as for the saints who are in the earth they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight 
their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god their drink offerings of blood i will not offer nor take their names on my lips 
yahweh assigned my portion and my cup you made my lot secure 
the lines have fallen to me in pleasant places yes i have a good inheritance 
i will bless yahweh who has given me counsel yes my heart instructs me in the night seasons 
i have set yahweh always before me because he is at my right hand i shall not be moved 
therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices my body shall also dwell in safety 
for you will not leave my soul in sheol neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption 
you will show me the path of life in your presence is fullness of joy in your right hand there are pleasures forevermore 
 a prayer by david hear yahweh my righteous plea give ear to my prayer that doesn t go out of deceitful lips 
let my sentence come forth from your presence let your eyes look on equity 
you have proved my heart you have visited me in the night you have tried me and found nothing i have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey 
as for the works of men by the word of your lips i have kept myself from the ways of the violent 
my steps have held fast to your paths my feet have not slipped 
i have called on you for you will answer me god turn your ear to me hear my speech 
show your marvelous loving kindness you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies 
keep me as the apple of your eye hide me under the shadow of your wings 
from the wicked who oppress me my deadly enemies who surround me 
they close up their callous hearts with their mouth they speak proudly 
they have now surrounded us in our steps they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth 
he is like a lion that is greedy of his prey as it were a young lion lurking in secret places 
arise yahweh confront him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword 
from men by your hand yahweh from men of the world whose portion is in this life you fill the belly of your cherished ones your sons have plenty and they store up wealth for their children 
as for me i shall see your face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with seeing your form 
 for the chief musician by david the servant of yahweh who spoke to yahweh the words of this song in the day that yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of saul he said i love you yahweh my strength 
yahweh is my rock my fortress and my deliverer my god my rock in whom i take refuge my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower 
i call on yahweh who is worthy to be praised and i am saved from my enemies 
the cords of death surrounded me the floods of ungodliness made me afraid 
the cords of sheol were around me the snares of death came on me 
in my distress i called on yahweh and cried to my god he heard my voice out of his temple my cry before him came into his ears 
then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken because he was angry 
smoke went out of his nostrils consuming fire came out of his mouth coals were kindled by it 
he bowed the heavens also and came down thick darkness was under his feet 
he rode on a cherub and flew yes he soared on the wings of the wind 
he made darkness his hiding place his pavilion around him darkness of waters thick clouds of the skies 
at the brightness before him his thick clouds passed hailstones and coals of fire 
yahweh also thundered in the sky the most high uttered his voice hailstones and coals of fire 
he sent out his arrows and scattered them yes great lightning bolts and routed them 
then the channels of waters appeared the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke yahweh at the blast of the breath of your nostrils 
he sent from on high he took me he drew me out of many waters 
he delivered me from my strong enemy from those who hated me for they were too mighty for me 
they came on me in the day of my calamity but yahweh was my support 
he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me 
yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me 
for i have kept the ways of yahweh and have not wickedly departed from my god 
for all his ordinances were before me i didn t put away his statutes from me 
i was also blameless with him i kept myself from my iniquity 
therefore yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight 
with the merciful you will show yourself merciful with the perfect man you will show yourself perfect 
with the pure you will show yourself pure with the crooked you will show yourself shrewd 
for you will save the afflicted people but the haughty eyes you will bring down 
for you will light my lamp yahweh my god will light up my darkness 
for by you i advance through a troop by my god i leap over a wall 
as for god his way is perfect the word of yahweh is tried he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him 
for who is god except yahweh ? who is a rock besides our god 
the god who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect ?
he makes my feet like deer s feet and sets me on my high places 
he teaches my hands to war so that my arms bend a bow of bronze 
you have also given me the shield of your salvation your right hand sustains me your gentleness has made me great 
you have enlarged my steps under me my feet have not slipped 
i will pursue my enemies and overtake them neither will i turn again until they are consumed 
i will strike them through so that they will not be able to rise they shall fall under my feet 
for you have armed me with strength to the battle you have subdued under me those who rose up against me 
you have also made my enemies turn their backs to me that i might cut off those who hate me 
they cried but there was none to save even to yahweh but he didn t answer them 
then i beat them small as the dust before the wind i cast them out as the mire of the streets 
you have delivered me from the strivings of the people you have made me the head of the nations a people whom i have not known shall serve me 
as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the foreigners shall submit themselves to me 
the foreigners shall fade away and shall come trembling out of their close places 
yahweh lives and blessed be my rock exalted be the god of my salvation 
even the god who executes vengeance for me and subdues peoples under me 
he rescues me from my enemies yes you lift me up above those who rise up against me you deliver me from the violent man 
therefore i will give thanks to you yahweh among the nations and will sing praises to your name 
he gives great deliverance to his king and shows loving kindness to his anointed to david and to his seed forevermore

our fathers trusted in you they trusted and you delivered them 
they cried to you and were delivered they trusted in you and were not disappointed 
but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised by the people 
all those who see me mock me they insult me with their lips they shake their heads saying 
 he trusts in yahweh let him deliver him let him rescue him since he delights in him 
but you brought me out of the womb you made me trust at my mother s breasts 
i was thrown on you from my mother s womb you are my god since my mother bore me

many bulls have surrounded me strong bulls of bashan have encircled me

i am poured out like water all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted within me 
my strength is dried up like a potsherd my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth you have brought me into the dust of death 
for dogs have surrounded me a company of evildoers have enclosed me they have pierced my hands and feet 
i can count all of my bones they look and stare at me 
they divide my garments among them they cast lots for my clothing 
but don t be far off yahweh you are my help hurry to help me

i hate the assembly of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked 
i will wash my hands in innocence so i will go about your altar yahweh 
that i may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard and tell of all your wondrous works 
yahweh i love the habitation of your house the place where your glory dwells 
don t gather my soul with sinners nor my life with bloodthirsty men 
in whose hands is wickedness their right hand is full of bribes 
but as for me i will walk in my integrity redeem me and be merciful to me 
my foot stands in an even place in the congregations i will bless yahweh 
 by david yahweh is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear ? yahweh is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid ?
when evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh even my adversaries and my foes they stumbled and fell 
though an army should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me even then i will be confident 
one thing i have asked of yahweh that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of yahweh all the days of my life to see yahweh s beauty and to inquire in his temple 
for in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion in the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me he will lift me up on a rock 
now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me i will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent i will sing yes i will sing praises to yahweh 
hear yahweh when i cry with my voice have mercy also on me and answer me 
when you said seek my face my heart said to you i will seek your face yahweh 
don t hide your face from me don t put your servant away in anger you have been my help don t abandon me neither forsake me god of my salvation 
when my father and my mother forsake me then yahweh will take me up 
teach me your way yahweh lead me in a straight path because of my enemies 
don t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries for false witnesses have risen up against me such as breathe out cruelty 
i am still confident of this i will see the goodness of yahweh in the land of the living 
wait for yahweh be strong and let your heart take courage yes wait for yahweh 
 by david to you yahweh i call my rock don t be deaf to me lest if you are silent to me i would become like those who go down into the pit 
hear the voice of my petitions when i cry to you when i lift up my hands toward your most holy place 
don t draw me away with the wicked with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors but mischief is in their hearts 
give them according to their work and according to the wickedness of their doings give them according to the operation of their hands bring back on them what they deserve 
because they don t respect the works of yahweh nor the operation of his hands he will break them down and not build them up 
blessed be yahweh because he has heard the voice of my petitions 
yahweh is my strength and my shield my heart has trusted in him and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoices with my song i will thank him 
yahweh is their strength he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed 
save your people and bless your inheritance be their shepherd also and bear them up forever

yahweh s voice is powerful yahweh s voice is full of majesty 
the voice of yahweh breaks the cedars yes yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of lebanon

 a psalm a song for the dedication of the temple by david i will extol you yahweh for you have raised me up and have not made my foes to rejoice over me 
yahweh my god i cried to you and you have healed me 
yahweh you have brought up my soul from sheol you have kept me alive that i should not go down to the pit 
sing praise to yahweh you saints of his give thanks to his holy name 
for his anger is but for a moment his favor is for a lifetime weeping may stay for the night but joy comes in the morning 
as for me i said in my prosperity i shall never be moved 
you yahweh when you favored me made my mountain stand strong but when you hid your face i was troubled 
i cried to you yahweh to yahweh i made supplication 
 what profit is there in my destruction if i go down to the pit ? shall the dust praise you ? shall it declare your truth ?
hear yahweh and have mercy on me yahweh be my helper 
you have turned my mourning into dancing for me you have removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness 
to the end that my heart may sing praise to you and not be silent yahweh my god i will give thanks to you forever !
 for the chief musician a psalm by david in you yahweh i take refuge let me never be disappointed deliver me in your righteousness 
bow down your ear to me deliver me speedily be to me a strong rock a house of defense to save me 
for you are my rock and my fortress therefore for your name s sake lead me and guide me 
pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me for you are my stronghold 
into your hand i commend my spirit you redeem me yahweh god of truth 
i hate those who regard lying vanities but i trust in yahweh 
i will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness for you have seen my affliction you have known my soul in adversities 
you have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy you have set my feet in a large place 
have mercy on me yahweh for i am in distress my eye my soul and my body waste away with grief 
for my life is spent with sorrow my years with sighing my strength fails because of my iniquity my bones are wasted away 
because of all my adversaries i have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors a fear to my acquaintances those who saw me on the street fled from me 
i am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man i am like broken pottery 
for i have heard the slander of many terror on every side while they conspire together against me they plot to take away my life 
but i trust in you yahweh i said you are my god 
my times are in your hand deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who persecute me 
make your face to shine on your servant save me in your loving kindness 
let me not be disappointed yahweh for i have called on you let the wicked be disappointed let them be silent in sheol 
let the lying lips be mute which speak against the righteous insolently with pride and contempt 
oh how great is your goodness which you have laid up for those who fear you which you have worked for those who take refuge in you before the sons of men !
in the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man you will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues 
praise be to yahweh for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city 
as for me i said in my haste i am cut off from before your eyes nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when i cried to you 
oh love yahweh all you his saints ! yahweh preserves the faithful and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly 
be strong and let your heart take courage all you who hope in yahweh 
 by david a contemplative psalm blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven whose sin is covered 
blessed is the man to whom yahweh doesn t impute iniquity in whose spirit there is no deceit 
when i kept silence my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long 
for day and night your hand was heavy on me my strength was sapped in the heat of summer selah 
i acknowledged my sin to you i didn t hide my iniquity i said i will confess my transgressions to yahweh and you forgave the iniquity of my sin selah 
for this let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach to him 
you are my hiding place you will preserve me from trouble you will surround me with songs of deliverance selah 
i will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go i will counsel you with my eye on you 
don t be like the horse or like the mule which have no understanding who are controlled by bit and bridle or else they will not come near to you 
many sorrows come to the wicked but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in yahweh 
be glad in yahweh and rejoice you righteous ! shout for joy all you who are upright in heart !
rejoice in yahweh you righteous ! praise is fitting for the upright 
give thanks to yahweh with the lyre sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings 
sing to him a new song play skillfully with a shout of joy !
for the word of yahweh is right all his work is done in faithfulness 
he loves righteousness and justice the earth is full of the loving kindness of yahweh 
by yahweh s word the heavens were made all their army by the breath of his mouth 
he gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap he lays up the deeps in storehouses 
let all the earth fear yahweh let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him 
for he spoke and it was done he commanded and it stood firm 
yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing he makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect 
the counsel of yahweh stands fast forever the thoughts of his heart to all generations 
blessed is the nation whose god is yahweh the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance 
yahweh looks from heaven he sees all the sons of men 
from the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth 
he who fashions all of their hearts and he considers all of their works 
there is no king saved by the multitude of an army a mighty man is not delivered by great strength 
a horse is a vain thing for safety neither does he deliver any by his great power 
behold yahweh s eye is on those who fear him on those who hope in his loving kindness 
to deliver their soul from death to keep them alive in famine 
our soul has waited for yahweh he is our help and our shield 
for our heart rejoices in him because we have trusted in his holy name 
 by david when he pretended to be insane before abimelech who drove him away and he departed psalm is an acrostic poem with each verse starting with a letter of the alphabet ordered from alef to tav i will bless yahweh at all times his praise will always be in my mouth 
my soul shall boast in yahweh the humble shall hear of it and be glad 
oh magnify yahweh with me let us exalt his name together 
i sought yahweh and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears 
they looked to him and were radiant their faces shall never be covered with shame 
this poor man cried and yahweh heard him and saved him out of all his troubles 
the angel of yahweh encamps around those who fear him and delivers them 
oh taste and see that yahweh is good blessed is the man who takes refuge in him 
oh fear yahweh you his saints for there is no lack with those who fear him 
the young lions do lack and suffer hunger but those who seek yahweh shall not lack any good thing 
come you children listen to me i will teach you the fear of yahweh 
who is someone who desires life and loves many days that he may see good ?
keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking lies 
depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it 
yahweh s eyes are toward the righteous his ears listen to their cry 
yahweh s face is against those who do evil to cut off their memory from the earth 
the righteous cry and yahweh hears and delivers them out of all their troubles 
yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart and saves those who have a crushed spirit 
many are the afflictions of the righteous but yahweh delivers him out of them all 
he protects all of his bones not one of them is broken 
evil shall kill the wicked those who hate the righteous shall be condemned 
yahweh redeems the soul of his servants none of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned 
 by david contend yahweh with those who contend with me fight against those who fight against me 
take hold of shield and buckler and stand up for my help 
brandish the spear and block those who pursue me tell my soul i am your salvation 
let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded 
let them be as chaff before the wind yahweh s angel driving them on 
let their way be dark and slippery yahweh s angel pursuing them 
for without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me without cause they have dug a pit for my soul 
let destruction come on him unawares let his net that he has hidden catch himself let him fall into that destruction 
my soul shall be joyful in yahweh it shall rejoice in his salvation 
all my bones shall say yahweh who is like you who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him yes the poor and the needy from him who robs him ? 
unrighteous witnesses rise up they ask me about things that i don t know about 
they reward me evil for good to the bereaving of my soul 
but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth i afflicted my soul with fasting my prayer returned into my own bosom 
i behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother i bowed down mourning as one who mourns his mother 
but in my adversity they rejoiced and gathered themselves together the attackers gathered themselves together against me and i didn t know it they tore at me and didn t cease 
like the profane mockers in feasts they gnashed their teeth at me 
lord how long will you look on ? rescue my soul from their destruction my precious life from the lions 
i will give you thanks in the great assembly i will praise you among many people 
don t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes 
for they don t speak peace but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land 
yes they opened their mouth wide against me they said aha ! aha ! our eye has seen it ! 
you have seen it yahweh don t keep silent lord don t be far from me 
wake up ! rise up to defend me my god ! my lord contend for me !
vindicate me yahweh my god according to your righteousness don t let them gloat over me 
don t let them say in their heart aha ! that s the way we want it ! don t let them say we have swallowed him up ! 
let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me 
let them shout for joy and be glad who favor my righteous cause yes let them say continually yahweh be magnified who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant ! 
my tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long 
 for the chief musician by david the servant of yahweh an oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked there is no fear of god before his eyes 
for he flatters himself in his own eyes too much to detect and hate his sin 
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he has ceased to be wise and to do good 
he plots iniquity on his bed he sets himself in a way that is not good he doesn t abhor evil 
your loving kindness yahweh is in the heavens your faithfulness reaches to the skies 
your righteousness is like the mountains of god your judgments are like a great deep yahweh you preserve man and animal 
how precious is your loving kindness god ! the children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings 
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house you will make them drink of the river of your pleasures 
for with you is the spring of life in your light shall we see light 
oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you your righteousness to the upright in heart 
don t let the foot of pride come against me don t let the hand of the wicked drive me away 
there the workers of iniquity are fallen they are thrust down and shall not be able to rise 
 by david don t fret because of evildoers neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness 
for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither like the green herb 
trust in yahweh and do good dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture 
also delight yourself in yahweh and he will give you the desires of your heart 
commit your way to yahweh trust also in him and he will do this 
he will make your righteousness go forth as the light and your justice as the noon day sun 
rest in yahweh and wait patiently for him don t fret because of him who prospers in his way because of the man who makes wicked plots happen 
cease from anger and forsake wrath don t fret it leads only to evildoing 
for evildoers shall be cut off but those who wait for yahweh shall inherit the land 
for yet a little while and the wicked will be no more yes though you look for his place he isn t there 
but the humble shall inherit the land and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace 
the wicked plots against the just and gnashes at him with his teeth 
the lord will laugh at him for he sees that his day is coming 
the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to cast down the poor and needy to kill those who are upright in the way 
their sword shall enter into their own heart their bows shall be broken 
better is a little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked 
for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but yahweh upholds the righteous 
yahweh knows the days of the perfect their inheritance shall be forever 
they shall not be disappointed in the time of evil in the days of famine they shall be satisfied 
but the wicked shall perish the enemies of yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields they will vanish vanish like smoke 
the wicked borrow and don t pay back but the righteous give generously 
for such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land those who are cursed by him shall be cut off 
a man s goings are established by yahweh he delights in his way 
though he stumble he shall not fall for yahweh holds him up with his hand 
i have been young and now am old yet i have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his children begging for bread 
all day long he deals graciously and lends his seed is blessed 
depart from evil and do good live securely forever 
for yahweh loves justice and doesn t forsake his saints they are preserved forever but the children of the wicked shall be cut off 
the righteous shall inherit the land and live in it forever 
the mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom his tongue speaks justice 
the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall slide 
the wicked watches the righteous and seeks to kill him 
yahweh will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judged 
wait for yahweh and keep his way and he will exalt you to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off you shall see it 
i have seen the wicked in great power spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil 
but he passed away and behold he was not yes i sought him but he could not be found 
mark the perfect man and see the upright for there is a future for the man of peace 
as for transgressors they shall be destroyed together the future of the wicked shall be cut off 
but the salvation of the righteous is from yahweh he is their stronghold in the time of trouble 
yahweh helps them and rescues them he rescues them from the wicked and saves them because they have taken refuge in him 
 a psalm by david for a memorial yahweh don t rebuke me in your wrath neither chasten me in your hot displeasure 
for your arrows have pierced me your hand presses hard on me 
there is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin 
for my iniquities have gone over my head as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me 
my wounds are loathsome and corrupt because of my foolishness 
i am pained and bowed down greatly i go mourning all day long 
for my waist is filled with burning there is no soundness in my flesh 
i am faint and severely bruised i have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart 
lord all my desire is before you my groaning is not hidden from you 
my heart throbs my strength fails me as for the light of my eyes it has also left me 
my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague my kinsmen stand far away 
they also who seek after my life lay snares those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things and meditate deceits all day long 
but i as a deaf man don t hear i am as a mute man who doesn t open his mouth 
yes i am as a man who doesn t hear in whose mouth are no reproofs 
for in you yahweh do i hope you will answer lord my god 
for i said don t let them gloat over me or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips 
for i am ready to fall my pain is continually before me 
for i will declare my iniquity i will be sorry for my sin 
but my enemies are vigorous and many those who hate me without reason are numerous 
they who also render evil for good are adversaries to me because i follow what is good 
don t forsake me yahweh my god don t be far from me 
hurry to help me lord my salvation 
 for the chief musician for jeduthun a psalm by david i said i will watch my ways so that i don t sin with my tongue i will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me 
i was mute with silence i held my peace even from good my sorrow was stirred 
my heart was hot within me while i meditated the fire burned i spoke with my tongue 
 yahweh show me my end what is the measure of my days let me know how frail i am 
behold you have made my days handbreadths my lifetime is as nothing before you surely every man stands as a breath selah 
 surely every man walks like a shadow surely they busy themselves in vain he heaps up and doesn t know who shall gather 
now lord what do i wait for ? my hope is in you 
deliver me from all my transgressions don t make me the reproach of the foolish 
i was mute i didn t open my mouth because you did it 
remove your scourge away from me i am overcome by the blow of your hand

 for the chief musician a psalm by david blessed is he who considers the poor yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil 
yahweh will preserve him and keep him alive he shall be blessed on the earth and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies 
yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed and restore him from his bed of illness 
i said yahweh have mercy on me ! heal me for i have sinned against you 
my enemies speak evil against me when will he die and his name perish ?

yes my own familiar friend in whom i trusted who ate bread with me has lifted up his heel against me 
but you yahweh have mercy on me and raise me up that i may repay them

 for the chief musician by the sons of korah a contemplative psalm we have heard with our ears god our fathers have told us what work you did in their days in the days of old 
you drove out the nations with your hand but you planted them you afflicted the peoples but you spread them abroad 
for they didn t get the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but your right hand and your arm and the light of your face because you were favorable to them 
you are my king god command victories for jacob !
through you will we push down our adversaries through your name will we tread them under who rise up against us 
for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me 
but you have saved us from our adversaries and have shamed those who hate us 
in god we have made our boast all day long we will give thanks to your name forever selah 
but now you rejected us and brought us to dishonor and don t go out with our armies 
you make us turn back from the adversary those who hate us take spoil for themselves 
you have made us like sheep for food and have scattered us among the nations 
you sell your people for nothing and have gained nothing from their sale 
you make us a reproach to our neighbors a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us 
you make us a byword among the nations a shaking of the head among the peoples 
all day long my dishonor is before me and shame covers my face 
at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses because of the enemy and the avenger 
all this has come on us yet have we not forgotten you neither have we been false to your covenant 
our heart has not turned back neither have our steps strayed from your path 
though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death 
if we have forgotten the name of our god or spread forth our hands to a strange god 
won t god search this out ? for he knows the secrets of the heart 
yes for your sake we are killed all day long we are regarded as sheep for the slaughter 
wake up ! why do you sleep lord ? arise ! don t reject us forever 
why do you hide your face and forget our affliction and our oppression ?
for our soul is bowed down to the dust our body clings to the earth 
rise up to help us redeem us for your loving kindness sake

both low and high rich and poor together 
my mouth will speak words of wisdom my heart shall utter understanding 
i will incline my ear to a proverb i will open my riddle on the harp 
why should i fear in the days of evil when iniquity at my heels surrounds me ?
those who trust in their wealth and boast in the multitude of their riches 
none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give god a ransom for him 
for the redemption of their life is costly no payment is ever enough 
that he should live on forever that he should not see corruption 
for he sees that wise men die likewise the fool and the senseless perish and leave their wealth to others 
their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever and their dwelling places to all generations they name their lands after themselves 
but man despite his riches doesn t endure he is like the animals that perish 
this is the destiny of those who are foolish and of those who approve their sayings selah 
they are appointed as a flock for sheol death shall be their shepherd the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning their beauty shall decay in sheol far from their mansion 
but god will redeem my soul from the power of sheol for he will receive me selah 
don t be afraid when a man is made rich when the glory of his house is increased 
for when he dies he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him 
though while he lived he blessed his soul and men praise you when you do well for yourself 
he shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never see the light 
a man who has riches without understanding is like the animals that perish 
 a psalm by asaph the mighty one god yahweh speaks and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset 
out of zion the perfection of beauty god shines forth 
our god comes and does not keep silent a fire devours before him it is very stormy around him 
he calls to the heavens above to the earth that he may judge his people 
 gather my saints together to me those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice 
the heavens shall declare his righteousness for god himself is judge selah 
 hear my people and i will speak israel and i will testify against you i am god your god 
i don t rebuke you for your sacrifices your burnt offerings are continually before me 
i have no need for a bull from your stall nor male goats from your pens 
for every animal of the forest is mine and the livestock on a thousand hills 
i know all the birds of the mountains the wild animals of the field are mine 
if i were hungry i would not tell you for the world is mine and all that is in it 
will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats ?
offer to god the sacrifice of thanksgiving pay your vows to the most high 
call on me in the day of trouble i will deliver you and you will honor me 
but to the wicked god says what right do you have to declare my statutes that you have taken my covenant on your lips 
since you hate instruction and throw my words behind you ?
when you saw a thief you consented with him and have participated with adulterers 
 you give your mouth to evil your tongue frames deceit 
you sit and speak against your brother you slander your own mother s son 
you have done these things and i kept silent you thought that i was just like you i will rebuke you and accuse you in front of your eyes 
 now consider this you who forget god lest i tear you into pieces and there be none to deliver 
whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me and prepares his way so that i will show god s salvation to him 
 for the chief musician a psalm by david when nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone in to bathsheba have mercy on me god according to your loving kindness according to the multitude of your tender mercies blot out my transgressions

for i know my transgressions my sin is constantly before me 
against you and you only have i sinned and done that which is evil in your sight that you may be proved right when you speak and justified when you judge 
behold i was brought forth in iniquity in sin my mother conceived me 
behold you desire truth in the inward parts you teach me wisdom in the inmost place 
purify me with hyssop and i will be clean wash me and i will be whiter than snow 
let me hear joy and gladness that the bones which you have broken may rejoice 
hide your face from my sins and blot out all of my iniquities 
create in me a clean heart o god renew a right spirit within me 
don t throw me from your presence and don t take your holy spirit from me 
restore to me the joy of your salvation uphold me with a willing spirit 
then i will teach transgressors your ways sinners shall be converted to you 
deliver me from bloodguiltiness o god the god of my salvation my tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness 
lord open my lips my mouth shall declare your praise

 for the chief musician a contemplation by david when doeg the edomite came and told saul david has come to abimelech s house why do you boast of mischief mighty man ? god s loving kindness endures continually

the righteous also will see it and fear and laugh at him saying

 for the chief musician to the tune of mahalath a contemplation by david the fool has said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity there is no one who does good 
god looks down from heaven on the children of men to see if there are any who understood who seek after god 
every one of them has gone back they have become filthy together there is no one who does good no not one 
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and don t call on god ?
there they were in great fear where no fear was for god has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you you have put them to shame because god has rejected them 
oh that the salvation of israel would come out of zion ! when god brings back his people from captivity then jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad 
 for the chief musician on stringed instruments a contemplation by david when the ziphites came and said to saul isn t david hiding himself among us ? save me god by your name vindicate me in your might 
hear my prayer god listen to the words of my mouth 
for strangers have risen up against me violent men have sought after my soul they haven t set god before them selah

fearfulness and trembling have come on me horror has overwhelmed me 
i said oh that i had wings like a dove ! then i would fly away and be at rest

for it was not an enemy who insulted me then i could have endured it neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me then i would have hidden myself from him 
but it was you a man like me my companion and my familiar friend 
we took sweet fellowship together we walked in god s house with company 
let death come suddenly on them let them go down alive into sheol for wickedness is in their dwelling in their midst 
as for me i will call on god yahweh will save me 
evening morning and at noon i will cry out in distress he will hear my voice 
he has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me although there are many who oppose me 
god who is enthroned forever will hear and answer them selah they never change who don t fear god 
he raises his hands against his friends he has violated his covenant 
his mouth was smooth as butter but his heart was war his words were softer than oil yet they were drawn swords

why do you look in envy you rugged mountains at the mountain where god chooses to reign ? yes yahweh will dwell there forever 
the chariots of god are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands the lord is among them from sinai into the sanctuary

blessed be the lord who daily bears our burdens even the god who is our salvation selah 
god is to us a god of deliverance to yahweh the lord belongs escape from death 
but god will strike through the head of his enemies the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness

that you may crush them dipping your foot in blood that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies

 for the chief musician to the tune of lilies by david save me god for the waters have come up to my neck !
i sink in deep mire where there is no foothold i have come into deep waters where the floods overflow me 
i am weary with my crying my throat is dry my eyes fail looking for my god 
those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head those who want to cut me off being my enemies wrongfully are mighty i have to restore what i didn t take away 
god you know my foolishness my sins aren t hidden from you 
don t let those who wait for you be shamed through me lord yahweh of armies don t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me god of israel 
because for your sake i have borne reproach shame has covered my face 
i have become a stranger to my brothers an alien to my mother s children 
for the zeal of your house consumes me the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me 
when i wept and i fasted that was to my reproach 
when i made sackcloth my clothing i became a byword to them 
those who sit in the gate talk about me i am the song of the drunkards 
but as for me my prayer is to you yahweh in an acceptable time god in the abundance of your loving kindness answer me in the truth of your salvation 
deliver me out of the mire and don t let me sink let me be delivered from those who hate me and out of the deep waters 
don t let the flood waters overwhelm me neither let the deep swallow me up don t let the pit shut its mouth on me 
answer me yahweh for your loving kindness is good according to the multitude of your tender mercies turn to me 
don t hide your face from your servant for i am in distress answer me speedily !
draw near to my soul and redeem it ransom me because of my enemies 
you know my reproach my shame and my dishonor my adversaries are all before you 
reproach has broken my heart and i am full of heaviness i looked for some to take pity but there was none for comforters but i found none 
they also gave me gall for my food in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink 
let their table before them become a snare may it become a retribution and a trap 
let their eyes be darkened so that they can t see let their backs be continually bent 
pour out your indignation on them let the fierceness of your anger overtake them 
let their habitation be desolate let no one dwell in their tents 
for they persecute him whom you have wounded they tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt 
charge them with crime upon crime don t let them come into your righteousness 
let them be blotted out of the book of life and not be written with the righteous 
but i am in pain and distress let your salvation god protect me 
i will praise the name of god with a song and will magnify him with thanksgiving 
it will please yahweh better than an ox or a bull that has horns and hoofs 
the humble have seen it and are glad you who seek after god let your heart live 
for yahweh hears the needy and doesn t despise his captive people

this ends the prayers by david the son of jesse 
 a psalm by asaph surely god is good to israel to those who are pure in heart 
but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had nearly slipped 
for i was envious of the arrogant when i saw the prosperity of the wicked 
for there are no struggles in their death but their strength is firm 
they are free from burdens of men neither are they plagued like other men 
therefore pride is like a chain around their neck violence covers them like a garment 
their eyes bulge with fat their minds pass the limits of conceit 
they scoff and speak with malice in arrogance they threaten oppression 
they have set their mouth in the heavens their tongue walks through the earth 
therefore their people return to them and they drink up waters of abundance 
they say how does god know ? is there knowledge in the most high ? 
behold these are the wicked being always at ease they increase in riches 
surely in vain i have cleansed my heart and washed my hands in innocence 
for all day long have i been plagued and punished every morning 
if i had said i will speak thus behold i would have betrayed the generation of your children 
when i tried to understand this it was too painful for me 
until i entered god s sanctuary and considered their latter end 
surely you set them in slippery places you throw them down to destruction 
how they are suddenly destroyed ! they are completely swept away with terrors 
as a dream when one wakes up so lord when you awake you will despise their fantasies 
nevertheless i am continually with you you have held my right hand 
you will guide me with your counsel and afterward receive me to glory 
whom do i have in heaven ? there is no one on earth whom i desire besides you 
my flesh and my heart fails but god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever 
for behold those who are far from you shall perish you have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you 
but it is good for me to come close to god i have made the lord yahweh my refuge that i may tell of all your works 
 a contemplation by asaph god why have you rejected us forever ? why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture ?
remember your congregation which you purchased of old which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance mount zion in which you have lived 
lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary 
your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly they have set up their standards as signs 
they behaved like men wielding axes cutting through a thicket of trees 
now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers 
they have burned your sanctuary to the ground they have profaned the dwelling place of your name 
they said in their heart we will crush them completely they have burned up all the places in the land where god was worshiped 
we see no miraculous signs there is no longer any prophet neither is there among us anyone who knows how long 
how long god shall the adversary reproach ? shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever ?
why do you draw back your hand even your right hand ? take it out of your pocket and consume them !
yet god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth 
you divided the sea by your strength you broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters 
you broke the heads of leviathan in pieces you gave him as food to people and desert creatures 
you opened up spring and stream you dried up mighty rivers 
the day is yours the night is also yours you have prepared the light and the sun 
you have set all the boundaries of the earth you have made summer and winter 
remember this that the enemy has mocked you yahweh foolish people have blasphemed your name 
don t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts don t forget the life of your poor forever 
honor your covenant for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth 
don t let the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy praise your name 
arise god ! plead your own cause remember how the foolish man mocks you all day 
don t forget the voice of your adversaries the tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually 
 for the chief musician to the tune of do not destroy a psalm by asaph a song we give thanks to you god we give thanks for your name is near men tell about your wondrous works 
when i choose the appointed time i will judge blamelessly 
the earth and all its inhabitants quake i firmly hold its pillars selah 
for neither from the east nor from the west nor yet from the south comes exaltation 
but god is the judge he puts down one and lifts up another 
for in the hand of yahweh there is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices he pours it out indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs 
but i will declare this forever i will sing praises to the god of jacob 
i will cut off all the horns of the wicked but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up 
 for the chief musician on stringed instruments a psalm by asaph a song in judah god is known his name is great in israel 
his tabernacle is also in salem his dwelling place in zion 
there he broke the flaming arrows of the bow the shield and the sword and the weapons of war selah 
glorious are you and excellent more than mountains of game 
valiant men lie plundered they have slept their last sleep none of the men of war can lift their hands 
at your rebuke god of jacob both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep 
you even you are to be feared who can stand in your sight when you are angry ?
surely the wrath of man praises you the survivors of your wrath are restrained 
make vows to yahweh your god and fulfill them ! let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared 
he will cut off the spirit of princes he is feared by the kings of the earth 
 for the chief musician to jeduthun a psalm by asaph my cry goes to god ! indeed i cry to god for help and for him to listen to me 
in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my hand was stretched out in the night and didn t get tired my soul refused to be comforted 
i remember god and i groan i complain and my spirit is overwhelmed selah 
you hold my eyelids open i am so troubled that i can t speak 
i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times 
i remember my song in the night i consider in my own heart my spirit diligently inquires 
 will the lord reject us forever ? will he be favorable no more ?
has his loving kindness vanished forever ? does his promise fail for generations ?
has god forgotten to be gracious ? has he in anger withheld his compassion ? selah 
then i thought i will appeal to this the years of the right hand of the most high 
i will remember yah s deeds for i will remember your wonders of old 
i will also meditate on all your work and consider your doings 
your way god is in the sanctuary what god is great like god ?
you are the god who does wonders you have made your strength known among the peoples 
you have redeemed your people with your arm the sons of jacob and joseph selah 
the waters saw you god the waters saw you and they writhed the depths also convulsed 
the clouds poured out water the skies resounded with thunder your arrows also flashed around 
the voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind the lightnings lit up the world the earth trembled and shook 
your way was through the sea your paths through the great waters your footsteps were not known 
you led your people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron 
 a contemplation by asaph hear my teaching my people turn your ears to the words of my mouth 
i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old 
which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us 
we will not hide them from their children telling to the generation to come the praises of yahweh his strength and his wondrous works that he has done 
for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a teaching in israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children 
that the generation to come might know even the children who should be born who should arise and tell their children 
that they might set their hope in god and not forget the works of god but keep his commandments 
and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that didn t make their hearts loyal whose spirit was not steadfast with god 
the children of ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned back in the day of battle 
they didn t keep god s covenant and refused to walk in his law 
they forgot his doings his wondrous works that he had shown them 
he did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers in the land of egypt in the field of zoan 
he split the sea and caused them to pass through he made the waters stand as a heap 
in the daytime he also led them with a cloud and all night with a light of fire 
he split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths 
he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers 
yet they still went on to sin against him to rebel against the most high in the desert 
they tempted god in their heart by asking food according to their desire 
yes they spoke against god they said can god prepare a table in the wilderness ?
behold he struck the rock so that waters gushed out and streams overflowed can he give bread also ? will he provide flesh for his people ? 
therefore yahweh heard and was angry a fire was kindled against jacob anger also went up against israel 
because they didn t believe in god and didn t trust in his salvation 
man ate the bread of angels he sent them food to the full 
he let them fall in the midst of their camp around their habitations 
so they ate and were well filled he gave them their own desire 
they didn t turn from their cravings their food was yet in their mouths 
when the anger of god went up against them killed some of their fattest and struck down the young men of israel 
for all this they still sinned and didn t believe in his wondrous works 
therefore he consumed their days in vanity and their years in terror 
when he killed them then they inquired after him they returned and sought god earnestly 
they remembered that god was their rock the most high god their redeemer 
but they flattered him with their mouth and lied to him with their tongue 
for their heart was not right with him neither were they faithful in his covenant 
but he being merciful forgave iniquity and didn t destroy them yes many times he turned his anger away and didn t stir up all his wrath 
he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passes away and doesn t come again 
how often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert !
they turned again and tempted god and provoked the holy one of israel 
they didn t remember his hand nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary 
how he set his signs in egypt his wonders in the field of zoan 
he turned their rivers into blood and their streams so that they could not drink 
he sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them and frogs which destroyed them 
he gave also their increase to the caterpillar and their labor to the locust 
he destroyed their vines with hail their sycamore fig trees with frost 
he gave over their livestock also to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts 
he threw on them the fierceness of his anger wrath indignation and trouble and a band of angels of evil 
he made a path for his anger he didn t spare their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilence 
and struck all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their strength in the tents of ham 
but he led forth his own people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock 
he led them safely so that they weren t afraid but the sea overwhelmed their enemies 
he brought them to the border of his sanctuary to this mountain which his right hand had taken 
he also drove out the nations before them allotted them for an inheritance by line and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tents 
yet they tempted and rebelled against the most high god and didn t keep his testimonies 
but turned back and dealt treacherously like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bow 
for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images 
when god heard this he was angry and greatly abhorred israel 
so that he forsook the tent of shiloh the tent which he placed among men 
and delivered his strength into captivity his glory into the adversary s hand 
he also gave his people over to the sword and was angry with his inheritance 
fire devoured their young men their virgins had no wedding song 
their priests fell by the sword and their widows couldn t weep 
then the lord awakened as one out of sleep like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine 
he struck his adversaries backward he put them to a perpetual reproach 
moreover he rejected the tent of joseph and didn t choose the tribe of ephraim 
but chose the tribe of judah mount zion which he loved 
he built his sanctuary like the heights like the earth which he has established forever 
he also chose david his servant and took him from the sheepfolds 
from following the ewes that have their young he brought him to be the shepherd of jacob his people and israel his inheritance 
so he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands 
 a psalm by asaph god the nations have come into your inheritance they have defiled your holy temple they have laid jerusalem in heaps 
they have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth 
their blood they have shed like water around jerusalem there was no one to bury them 
we have become a reproach to our neighbors a scoffing and derision to those who are around us 
how long yahweh ? will you be angry forever ? will your jealousy burn like fire ?
pour out your wrath on the nations that don t know you on the kingdoms that don t call on your name 
for they have devoured jacob and destroyed his homeland 
don t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us let your tender mercies speedily meet us for we are in desperate need 
help us god of our salvation for the glory of your name deliver us and forgive our sins for your name s sake 
why should the nations say where is their god ? let it be known among the nations before our eyes that vengeance for your servants blood is being poured out 
let the sighing of the prisoner come before you according to the greatness of your power preserve those who are sentenced to death 
pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you lord 
so we your people and sheep of your pasture will give you thanks forever we will praise you forever to all generations 
 for the chief musician to the tune of the lilies of the covenant a psalm by asaph hear us shepherd of israel you who lead joseph like a flock you who sit above the cherubim shine forth 
before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up your might ! come to save us !
turn us again god cause your face to shine and we will be saved 
yahweh god of armies how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people ?
you have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in large measure 
you make us a source of contention to our neighbors our enemies laugh among themselves 
turn us again god of armies cause your face to shine and we will be saved 
you brought a vine out of egypt you drove out the nations and planted it 
you cleared the ground for it it took deep root and filled the land 
the mountains were covered with its shadow its boughs were like god s cedars 
it sent out its branches to the sea its shoots to the river 
why have you broken down its walls so that all those who pass by the way pluck it ?
the boar out of the wood ravages it the wild animals of the field feed on it 
turn again we beg you god of armies look down from heaven and see and visit this vine 
the stock which your right hand planted the branch that you made strong for yourself 
it s burned with fire it s cut down they perish at your rebuke 
let your hand be on the man of your right hand on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself 
so we will not turn away from you revive us and we will call on your name 
turn us again yahweh god of armies cause your face to shine and we will be saved 
 for the chief musician on an instrument of gath by asaph sing aloud to god our strength ! make a joyful shout to the god of jacob !
raise a song and bring here the tambourine the pleasant lyre with the harp 
blow the trumpet at the new moon at the full moon on our feast day 
for it is a statute for israel an ordinance of the god of jacob 
he appointed it in joseph for a testimony when he went out over the land of egypt i heard a language that i didn t know 
 i removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were freed from the basket 
you called in trouble and i delivered you i answered you in the secret place of thunder i tested you at the waters of meribah selah 
 hear my people and i will testify to you israel if you would listen to me !
there shall be no strange god in you neither shall you worship any foreign god 
i am yahweh your god who brought you up out of the land of egypt open your mouth wide and i will fill it 
but my people didn t listen to my voice israel desired none of me 
so i let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts that they might walk in their own counsels 
oh that my people would listen to me that israel would walk in my ways !
i would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their adversaries 
the haters of yahweh would cringe before him and their punishment would last forever 
but he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat i will satisfy you with honey out of the rock 
 a psalm by asaph god presides in the great assembly he judges among the gods 
 how long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked ? selah 
 defend the weak the poor and the fatherless maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed 
rescue the weak and needy deliver them out of the hand of the wicked 
they don t know neither do they understand they walk back and forth in darkness all the foundations of the earth are shaken

nevertheless you shall die like men and fall like one of the rulers 
arise god judge the earth for you inherit all of the nations 
 a song a psalm by asaph god don t keep silent don t keep silent and don t be still god 
for behold your enemies are stirred up those who hate you have lifted up their heads 
they conspire with cunning against your people they plot against your cherished ones 
 come they say and let s destroy them as a nation that the name of israel may be remembered no more 
for they have conspired together with one mind they form an alliance against you 
assyria also is joined with them they have helped the children of lot selah 
do to them as you did to midian as to sisera as to jabin at the river kishon 
who perished at endor who became as dung for the earth 
make their nobles like oreb and zeeb yes all their princes like zebah and zalmunna 
who said let us take possession of god s pasturelands 
my god make them like tumbleweed like chaff before the wind 
as the fire that burns the forest as the flame that sets the mountains on fire 
so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm 
fill their faces with confusion that they may seek your name yahweh 
let them be disappointed and dismayed forever yes let them be confounded and perish 
that they may know that you alone whose name is yahweh are the most high over all the earth 
 for the chief musician on an instrument of gath a psalm by the sons of korah how lovely are your dwellings yahweh of armies !

 a psalm by the sons of korah a song his foundation is in the holy mountains

 a song a psalm by the sons of korah for the chief musician to the tune of the suffering of affliction a contemplation by heman the ezrahite yahweh the god of my salvation i have cried day and night before you 
let my prayer enter into your presence turn your ear to my cry 
for my soul is full of troubles my life draws near to sheol 
i am counted among those who go down into the pit i am like a man who has no help 
set apart among the dead like the slain who lie in the grave whom you remember no more they are cut off from your hand 
you have laid me in the lowest pit in the darkest depths 
your wrath lies heavily on me you have afflicted me with all your waves selah 
you have taken my friends from me you have made me an abomination to them i am confined and i can t escape 
my eyes are dim from grief i have called on you daily yahweh i have spread out my hands to you 
do you show wonders to the dead ? do the dead rise up and praise you ? selah 
is your loving kindness declared in the grave ? or your faithfulness in destruction ?
are your wonders made known in the dark ? or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness ?
but to you yahweh i have cried in the morning my prayer comes before you 
yahweh why do you reject my soul ? why do you hide your face from me ?
i am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while i suffer your terrors i am distracted 
your fierce wrath has gone over me your terrors have cut me off 
they came around me like water all day long they completely engulfed me 
you have put lover and friend far from me and my friends into darkness 
 a contemplation by ethan the ezrahite i will sing of the loving kindness of yahweh forever with my mouth i will make known your faithfulness to all generations 
i indeed declare love stands firm forever you established the heavens your faithfulness is in them 
 i have made a covenant with my chosen one i have sworn to david my servant 
 i will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to all generations selah 
the heavens will praise your wonders yahweh your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones 
for who in the skies can be compared to yahweh ? who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like yahweh 
a very awesome god in the council of the holy ones to be feared above all those who are around him ?
yahweh god of armies who is a mighty one like you ? yah your faithfulness is around you 
you rule the pride of the sea when its waves rise up you calm them

the north and the south you have created them tabor and hermon rejoice in your name 
you have a mighty arm your hand is strong and your right hand is exalted 
righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne loving kindness and truth go before your face 
blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you they walk in the light of your presence yahweh 
in your name they rejoice all day in your righteousness they are exalted 
for you are the glory of their strength in your favor our horn will be exalted 
for our shield belongs to yahweh our king to the holy one of israel 
then you spoke in vision to your saints and said i have bestowed strength on the warrior i have exalted a young man from the people 
i have found david my servant i have anointed him with my holy oil 
with whom my hand shall be established my arm will also strengthen him 
no enemy will tax him no wicked man will oppress him 
i will beat down his adversaries before him and strike those who hate him 
but my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him in my name his horn will be exalted 
i will set his hand also on the sea and his right hand on the rivers 
he will call to me you are my father my god and the rock of my salvation ! 
i will also appoint him my firstborn the highest of the kings of the earth 
i will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore my covenant will stand firm with him 
i will also make his seed endure forever and his throne as the days of heaven 
if his children forsake my law and don t walk in my ordinances 
if they break my statutes and don t keep my commandments 
then i will punish their sin with the rod and their iniquity with stripes 
but i will not completely take my loving kindness from him nor allow my faithfulness to fail 
i will not break my covenant nor alter what my lips have uttered 
once have i sworn by my holiness i will not lie to david 
his seed will endure forever his throne like the sun before me 
it will be established forever like the moon the faithful witness in the sky selah 
but you have rejected and spurned you have been angry with your anointed 
you have renounced the covenant of your servant you have defiled his crown in the dust 
you have broken down all his hedges you have brought his strongholds to ruin 
all who pass by the way rob him he has become a reproach to his neighbors 
you have exalted the right hand of his adversaries you have made all of his enemies rejoice 
yes you turn back the edge of his sword and haven t supported him in battle 
you have ended his splendor and thrown his throne down to the ground 
you have shortened the days of his youth you have covered him with shame selah 
how long yahweh ? will you hide yourself forever ? will your wrath burn like fire ?
remember how short my time is ! for what vanity have you created all the children of men !
what man is he who shall live and not see death who shall deliver his soul from the power of sheol ? selah 
lord where are your former loving kindnesses which you swore to david in your faithfulness ?
blessed be yahweh forevermore amen and amen 
 a prayer by moses the man of godthe hebrew word rendered god is elohim lord you have been our dwelling place for all generations 
before the mountains were brought forth before you had formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting you are god 
you turn man to destruction saying return you children of men 
for a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past like a watch in the night 
you sweep them away as they sleep in the morning they sprout like new grass 
in the morning it sprouts and springs up by evening it is withered and dry 
for we are consumed in your anger we are troubled in your wrath 
you have set our iniquities before you our secret sins in the light of your presence 
for all our days have passed away in your wrath we bring our years to an end as a sigh 
the days of our years are seventy or even by reason of strength eighty years yet their pride is but labor and sorrow for it passes quickly and we fly away 
who knows the power of your anger your wrath according to the fear that is due to you ?
so teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom 
relent yahweh ! how long ? have compassion on your servants !
satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness that we may rejoice and be glad all our days 
make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us for as many years as we have seen evil 
let your work appear to your servants your glory to their children 
let the favor of the lord our god be on us establish the work of our hands for us yes establish the work of our hands 
he who dwells in the secret place of the most high will rest in the shadow of the almighty 
i will say of yahweh he is my refuge and my fortress my god in whom i trust 
for he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence 
he will cover you with his feathers under his wings you will take refuge his faithfulness is your shield and rampart 
you shall not be afraid of the terror by night nor of the arrow that flies by day 
nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday 
a thousand may fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand but it will not come near you 
you will only look with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked 
because you have made yahweh your refuge and the most high your dwelling place 
no evil shall happen to you neither shall any plague come near your dwelling 
for he will put his angels in charge of you to guard you in all your ways 
they will bear you up in their hands so that you won t dash your foot against a stone 
you will tread on the lion and cobra you will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot 
 because he has set his love on me therefore i will deliver him i will set him on high because he has known my name 
he will call on me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him 
i will satisfy him with long life and show him my salvation 
 a psalm a song for the sabbath day it is a good thing to give thanks to yahweh to sing praises to your name most high 
to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning and your faithfulness every night 
with the ten stringed lute with the harp and with the melody of the lyre 
for you yahweh have made me glad through your work i will triumph in the works of your hands 
how great are your works yahweh ! your thoughts are very deep 
a senseless man doesn t know neither does a fool understand this 
though the wicked spring up as the grass and all the evildoers flourish they will be destroyed forever 
but you yahweh are on high forevermore 
for behold your enemies yahweh for behold your enemies shall perish all the evildoers will be scattered 
but you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox i am anointed with fresh oil 
my eye has also seen my enemies my ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me 
they will still bring forth fruit in old age they will be full of sap and green 
to show that yahweh is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him 
yahweh reigns ! he is clothed with majesty ! yahweh is armed with strength the world also is established it can t be moved 
your throne is established from long ago you are from everlasting 
the floods have lifted up yahweh the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves 
above the voices of many waters the mighty breakers of the sea yahweh on high is mighty 
your statutes stand firm holiness adorns your house yahweh forevermore 
yahweh you god to whom vengeance belongs you god to whom vengeance belongs shine forth 
rise up you judge of the earth pay back the proud what they deserve 
yahweh how long will the wicked how long will the wicked triumph ?
they pour out arrogant words all the evildoers boast 
they break your people in pieces yahweh and afflict your heritage 
they kill the widow and the alien and murder the fatherless 
they say yah will not see neither will jacob s god consider 
consider you senseless among the people you fools when will you be wise ?
he who implanted the ear won t he hear ? he who formed the eye won t he see ?
he who disciplines the nations won t he punish ? he who teaches man knows 
yahweh knows the thoughts of man that they are futile 
blessed is the man whom you discipline yah and teach out of your law 
that you may give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit is dug for the wicked 
for yahweh won t reject his people neither will he forsake his inheritance 
for judgment will return to righteousness all the upright in heart shall follow it 
who will rise up for me against the wicked ? who will stand up for me against the evildoers ?
unless yahweh had been my help my soul would have soon lived in silence 
when i said my foot is slipping ! your loving kindness yahweh held me up 
in the multitude of my thoughts within me your comforts delight my soul 
shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you which brings about mischief by statute ?
they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood 
but yahweh has been my high tower my god the rock of my refuge 
he has brought on them their own iniquity and will cut them off in their own wickedness yahweh our god will cut them off 
oh come let s sing to yahweh let s shout aloud to the rock of our salvation !

for he is our god we are the people of his pasture and the sheep in his care today oh that you would hear his voice !
don t harden your heart as at meribah as in the day of massah in the wilderness 
when your fathers tempted me tested me and saw my work 
forty long years i was grieved with that generation and said it is a people that errs in their heart they have not known my ways 
therefore i swore in my wrath they won t enter into my rest

you answered them yahweh our god you are a god who forgave them although you took vengeance for their doings

 a psalm by david i will sing of loving kindness and justice to you yahweh i will sing praises 
i will be careful to live a blameless life when will you come to me ? i will walk within my house with a blameless heart 
i will set no vile thing before my eyes i hate the deeds of faithless men they will not cling to me 
a perverse heart will be far from me i will have nothing to do with evil 
i will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor i won t tolerate one who is haughty and conceited 
my eyes will be on the faithful of the land that they may dwell with me he who walks in a perfect way he will serve me 
he who practices deceit won t dwell within my house he who speaks falsehood won t be established before my eyes 
morning by morning i will destroy all the wicked of the land to cut off all the workers of iniquity from yahweh s city 
 a prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before yahweh hear my prayer yahweh ! let my cry come to you 
don t hide your face from me in the day of my distress turn your ear to me answer me quickly in the day when i call 
for my days consume away like smoke my bones are burned as a torch 
my heart is blighted like grass and withered for i forget to eat my bread 
by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones stick to my skin 
i am like a pelican of the wilderness i have become as an owl of the waste places 
i watch and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop 
my enemies reproach me all day those who are mad at me use my name as a curse 
for i have eaten ashes like bread and mixed my drink with tears 
because of your indignation and your wrath for you have taken me up and thrown me away 
my days are like a long shadow i have withered like grass 
but you yahweh will remain forever your renown endures to all generations 
you will arise and have mercy on zion for it is time to have pity on her yes the set time has come 
for your servants take pleasure in her stones and have pity on her dust 
so the nations will fear the name of yahweh all the kings of the earth your glory 
for yahweh has built up zion he has appeared in his glory 
he has responded to the prayer of the destitute and has not despised their prayer 
this will be written for the generation to come a people which will be created will praise yah 
for he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven yahweh saw the earth 
to hear the groans of the prisoner to free those who are condemned to death 
that men may declare the name of yahweh in zion and his praise in jerusalem 
when the peoples are gathered together the kingdoms to serve yahweh 
he weakened my strength along the course he shortened my days 
i said my god don t take me away in the midst of my days your years are throughout all generations 
of old you laid the foundation of the earth the heavens are the work of your hands 
they will perish but you will endure yes all of them will wear out like a garment you will change them like a cloak and they will be changed 
but you are the same your years will have no end 
the children of your servants will continue their seed will be established before you 
 by david praise yahweh my soul ! all that is within me praise his holy name !
praise yahweh my soul and don t forget all his benefits 
who forgives all your sins who heals all your diseases 
who redeems your life from destruction who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies 
who satisfies your desire with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle s 
yahweh executes righteous acts and justice for all who are oppressed 
he made known his ways to moses his deeds to the children of israel 
yahweh is merciful and gracious slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness 
he will not always accuse neither will he stay angry forever 
he has not dealt with us according to our sins nor repaid us for our iniquities 
for as the heavens are high above the earth so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him 
as far as the east is from the west so far has he removed our transgressions from us 
like a father has compassion on his children so yahweh has compassion on those who fear him 
for he knows how we are made he remembers that we are dust 
as for man his days are like grass as a flower of the field so he flourishes 
for the wind passes over it and it is gone its place remembers it no more 
but yahweh s loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him his righteousness to children s children 
to those who keep his covenant to those who remember to obey his precepts 
yahweh has established his throne in the heavens his kingdom rules over all 
praise yahweh you angels of his who are mighty in strength who fulfill his word obeying the voice of his word 
praise yahweh all you armies of his you servants of his who do his pleasure 
praise yahweh all you works of his in all places of his dominion praise yahweh my soul !
bless yahweh my soul yahweh my god you are very great you are clothed with honor and majesty 
he covers himself with light as with a garment he stretches out the heavens like a curtain 
he lays the beams of his rooms in the waters he makes the clouds his chariot he walks on the wings of the wind 
he makes his messengers winds his servants flames of fire 
he laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be moved forever 
you covered it with the deep as with a cloak the waters stood above the mountains 
at your rebuke they fled at the voice of your thunder they hurried away 
the mountains rose the valleys sank down to the place which you had assigned to them 
you have set a boundary that they may not pass over that they don t turn again to cover the earth 
he sends forth springs into the valleys they run among the mountains 
they give drink to every animal of the field the wild donkeys quench their thirst 
the birds of the sky nest by them they sing among the branches 
he waters the mountains from his rooms the earth is filled with the fruit of your works 
he causes the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate that he may bring forth food out of the earth 
wine that makes glad the heart of man oil to make his face to shine and bread that strengthens man s heart 
yahweh s trees are well watered the cedars of lebanon which he has planted 
where the birds make their nests the stork makes its home in the fir trees 
the high mountains are for the wild goats the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers 
he appointed the moon for seasons the sun knows when to set 
you make darkness and it is night in which all the animals of the forest prowl 
the young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from god 
the sun rises and they steal away and lay down in their dens 
man goes forth to his work to his labor until the evening 
yahweh how many are your works ! in wisdom have you made them all the earth is full of your riches 
there is the sea great and wide in which are innumerable living things both small and large animals 
there the ships go and leviathan whom you formed to play there 
these all wait for you that you may give them their food in due season 
you give to them they gather you open your hand they are satisfied with good 
you hide your face they are troubled you take away their breath they die and return to the dust 
you send forth your spirit they are created you renew the face of the ground 
let the glory of yahweh endure forever let yahweh rejoice in his works 
he looks at the earth and it trembles he touches the mountains and they smoke 
i will sing to yahweh as long as i live i will sing praise to my god while i have any being 
let your meditation be sweet to him i will rejoice in yahweh 
let sinners be consumed out of the earth let the wicked be no more bless yahweh my soul praise yah !
give thanks to yahweh ! call on his name ! make his doings known among the peoples 
sing to him sing praises to him ! tell of all his marvelous works 
glory in his holy name let the heart of those who seek yahweh rejoice 
seek yahweh and his strength seek his face forever more 
remember his marvelous works that he has done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth 
you seed of abraham his servant you children of jacob his chosen ones 
he is yahweh our god his judgments are in all the earth 
he has remembered his covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations 
the covenant which he made with abraham his oath to isaac 
and confirmed the same to jacob for a statute to israel for an everlasting covenant 
saying to you i will give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance 
when they were but a few men in number yes very few and foreigners in it 
they went about from nation to nation from one kingdom to another people 
he allowed no one to do them wrong yes he reproved kings for their sakes 
 don t touch my anointed ones ! do my prophets no harm ! 
he called for a famine on the land he destroyed the food supplies 
he sent a man before them joseph was sold for a slave 
they bruised his feet with shackles his neck was locked in irons 
until the time that his word happened and yahweh s word proved him true 
the king sent and freed him even the ruler of peoples and let him go free 
he made him lord of his house and ruler of all of his possessions 
to discipline his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom 
israel also came into egypt jacob lived in the land of ham 
he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their adversaries 
he turned their heart to hate his people to conspire against his servants 
he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen 
they performed miracles among them and wonders in the land of ham 
he sent darkness and made it dark they didn t rebel against his words 
he turned their waters into blood and killed their fish 
their land swarmed with frogs even in the rooms of their kings 
he spoke and swarms of flies came and lice in all their borders 
he gave them hail for rain with lightning in their land 
he struck their vines and also their fig trees and shattered the trees of their country 
he spoke and the locusts came and the grasshoppers without number 
ate up every plant in their land and ate up the fruit of their ground 
he struck also all the firstborn in their land the first fruits of all their manhood 
he brought them forth with silver and gold there was not one feeble person among his tribes 
egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them had fallen on them 
he spread a cloud for a covering fire to give light in the night 
they asked and he brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of the sky 
he opened the rock and waters gushed out they ran as a river in the dry places 
for he remembered his holy word and abraham his servant 
he brought forth his people with joy his chosen with singing 
he gave them the lands of the nations they took the labor of the peoples in possession 
that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws praise yah !
praise yahweh ! give thanks to yahweh for he is good for his loving kindness endures forever 
who can utter the mighty acts of yahweh or fully declare all his praise ?
blessed are those who keep justice blessed is one who does what is right at all times 
remember me yahweh with the favor that you show to your people visit me with your salvation 
that i may see the prosperity of your chosen that i may rejoice in the gladness of your nation that i may glory with your inheritance 
we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly 
our fathers didn t understand your wonders in egypt they didn t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses but were rebellious at the sea even at the red sea 
nevertheless he saved them for his name s sake that he might make his mighty power known 
he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through a desert 
he saved them from the hand of him who hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy 
the waters covered their adversaries there was not one of them left 
then they believed his words they sang his praise 
they soon forgot his works they didn t wait for his counsel 
but gave in to craving in the desert and tested god in the wasteland 
he gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul 
they envied moses also in the camp and aaron yahweh s saint 
the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the company of abiram 
a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up the wicked 
they made a calf in horeb and worshiped a molten image 
thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass 
they forgot god their savior who had done great things in egypt 
wondrous works in the land of ham and awesome things by the red sea 
therefore he said that he would destroy them had moses his chosen not stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath so that he wouldn t destroy them 
yes they despised the pleasant land they didn t believe his word 
but murmured in their tents and didn t listen to yahweh s voice 
therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness 
that he would overthrow their seed among the nations and scatter them in the lands 
they joined themselves also to baal peor and ate the sacrifices of the dead 
thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds the plague broke in on them 
then phinehas stood up and executed judgment so the plague was stopped 
that was credited to him for righteousness for all generations to come 
they angered him also at the waters of meribah so that moses was troubled for their sakes 
because they were rebellious against his spirit he spoke rashly with his lips 
they didn t destroy the peoples as yahweh commanded them 
but mixed themselves with the nations and learned their works 
they served their idols which became a snare to them 
yes they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons 
they shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of canaan the land was polluted with blood 
thus were they defiled with their works and prostituted themselves in their deeds 
therefore yahweh burned with anger against his people he abhorred his inheritance 
he gave them into the hand of the nations those who hated them ruled over them 
their enemies also oppressed them they were brought into subjection under their hand 
many times he delivered them but they were rebellious in their counsel and were brought low in their iniquity 
nevertheless he regarded their distress when he heard their cry 
he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses 
he made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive 
save us yahweh our god gather us from among the nations to give thanks to your holy name to triumph in your praise !
blessed be yahweh the god of israel from everlasting even to everlasting ! let all the people say amen praise yah !
give thanks to yahweh for he is good for his loving kindness endures forever 
let the redeemed by yahweh say so whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary 
and gathered out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south 
they wandered in the wilderness in a desert way they found no city to live in 
hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them 
then they cried to yahweh in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses 
he led them also by a straight way that they might go to a city to live in 
let them praise yahweh for his loving kindness for his wonderful works to the children of men !
for he satisfies the longing soul he fills the hungry soul with good 
some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in affliction and iron 
because they rebelled against the words of god and condemned the counsel of the most high 
therefore he brought down their heart with labor they fell down and there was none to help 
then they cried to yahweh in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses 
he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke their bonds in sunder 
let them praise yahweh for his loving kindness for his wonderful works to the children of men !
for he has broken the gates of brass and cut through bars of iron 
fools are afflicted because of their disobedience and because of their iniquities 
their soul abhors all kinds of food they draw near to the gates of death 
then they cry to yahweh in their trouble he saves them out of their distresses 
he sends his word and heals them and delivers them from their graves 
let them praise yahweh for his loving kindness for his wonderful works to the children of men !
let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with singing 
those who go down to the sea in ships who do business in great waters 
these see yahweh s works and his wonders in the deep 
for he commands and raises the stormy wind which lifts up its waves 
they mount up to the sky they go down again to the depths their soul melts away because of trouble 
they reel back and forth and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits end 
then they cry to yahweh in their trouble and he brings them out of their distress 
he makes the storm a calm so that its waves are still 
then they are glad because it is calm so he brings them to their desired haven 
let them praise yahweh for his loving kindness for his wonderful works for the children of men !
let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people and praise him in the seat of the elders 
he turns rivers into a desert water springs into a thirsty ground 
and a fruitful land into a salt waste for the wickedness of those who dwell in it 
he turns a desert into a pool of water and a dry land into water springs 
there he makes the hungry live that they may prepare a city to live in 
sow fields plant vineyards and reap the fruits of increase 
he blesses them also so that they are multiplied greatly he doesn t allow their livestock to decrease 
again they are diminished and bowed down through oppression trouble and sorrow 
he pours contempt on princes and causes them to wander in a trackless waste 
yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction and increases their families like a flock 
the upright will see it and be glad all the wicked will shut their mouths 
whoever is wise will pay attention to these things they will consider the loving kindnesses of yahweh 
 a song a psalm by david my heart is steadfast god i will sing and i will make music with my soul 
wake up harp and lyre ! i will wake up the dawn 
i will give thanks to you yahweh among the nations i will sing praises to you among the peoples 
for your loving kindness is great above the heavens your faithfulness reaches to the skies 
be exalted god above the heavens ! let your glory be over all the earth 
that your beloved may be delivered save with your right hand and answer us 
god has spoken from his sanctuary in triumph i will divide shechem and measure out the valley of succoth 
gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim also is my helmet judah is my scepter 
moab is my wash pot i will toss my sandal on edom i will shout over philistia 
who will bring me into the fortified city ? who has led me to edom ?
haven t you rejected us god ? you don t go forth god with our armies 
give us help against the enemy for the help of man is vain 
through god we will do valiantly for it is he who will tread down our enemies 
 for the chief musician a psalm by david god of my praise don t remain silent 
for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me they have spoken to me with a lying tongue 
they have also surrounded me with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause 
in return for my love they are my adversaries but i am in prayer 
they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love 
set a wicked man over him let an adversary stand at his right hand 
when he is judged let him come forth guilty let his prayer be turned into sin 
let his days be few let another take his office 
let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow 
let his children be wandering beggars let them be sought from their ruins 
let the creditor seize all that he has let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor 
let there be no one to extend kindness to him neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children 
let his posterity be cut off in the generation following let their name be blotted out 
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by yahweh don t let the sin of his mother be blotted out 
let them be before yahweh continually that he may cut off their memory from the earth 
because he didn t remember to show kindness but persecuted the poor and needy man the broken in heart to kill them 
yes he loved cursing and it came to him he didn t delight in blessing and it was far from him 
he clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment it came into his inward parts like water like oil into his bones 
let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself for the belt that is always around him 
this is the reward of my adversaries from yahweh of those who speak evil against my soul 
but deal with me yahweh the lord for your name s sake because your loving kindness is good deliver me 
for i am poor and needy my heart is wounded within me 
i fade away like an evening shadow i am shaken off like a locust 
my knees are weak through fasting my body is thin and lacks fat 
i have also become a reproach to them when they see me they shake their head 
help me yahweh my god save me according to your loving kindness 
that they may know that this is your hand that you yahweh have done it 
they may curse but you bless when they arise they will be shamed but your servant shall rejoice 
let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe 
i will give great thanks to yahweh with my mouth yes i will praise him among the multitude 
for he will stand at the right hand of the needy to save him from those who judge his soul 
 a psalm by david yahweh says to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool for your feet 
yahweh will send forth the rod of your strength out of zion rule in the midst of your enemies 
your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power in holy array out of the womb of the morning you have the dew of your youth 
yahweh has sworn and will not change his mind you are a priest forever in the order of melchizedek 
the lord is at your right hand he will crush kings in the day of his wrath 
he will judge among the nations he will heap up dead bodies he will crush the ruler of the whole earth 
he will drink of the brook in the way therefore he will lift up his head 
praise yah ! i will give thanks to yahweh with my whole heart in the council of the upright and in the congregation 
yahweh s works are great pondered by all those who delight in them 
his work is honor and majesty his righteousness endures forever

that he may set him with princes even with the princes of his people

sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper 
woe is me that i live in meshech that i dwell among the tents of kedar !
my soul has had her dwelling too long with him who hates peace 
i am for peace but when i speak they are for war 
 a song of ascents i will lift up my eyes to the hills where does my help come from ?
my help comes from yahweh who made heaven and earth 
he will not allow your foot to be moved he who keeps you will not slumber 
behold he who keeps israel will neither slumber nor sleep 
yahweh is your keeper yahweh is your shade on your right hand 
the sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night 
yahweh will keep you from all evil he will keep your soul 
yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore 
 a song of ascents by david i was glad when they said to me let s go to yahweh s house ! 
our feet are standing within your gates jerusalem 
jerusalem that is built as a city that is compact together 
where the tribes go up even yah s tribes according to an ordinance for israel to give thanks to the name of yahweh 
for there are set thrones for judgment the thrones of david s house 
pray for the peace of jerusalem those who love you will prosper 
peace be within your walls and prosperity within your palaces 
for my brothers and companions sakes i will now say peace be within you 
 a song of ascents to you i do lift up my eyes you who sit in the heavens 
behold as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress so our eyes look to yahweh our god until he has mercy on us 
have mercy on us yahweh have mercy on us for we have endured much contempt 
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease with the contempt of the proud 
 a song of ascents by david if it had not been yahweh who was on our side let israel now say 
if it had not been yahweh who was on our side when men rose up against us 
then they would have swallowed us up alive when their wrath was kindled against us 
then the waters would have overwhelmed us the stream would have gone over our soul 
then the proud waters would have gone over our soul 
blessed be yahweh who has not given us as a prey to their teeth 
our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler s snare the snare is broken and we have escaped 
our help is in the name of yahweh who made heaven and earth 
 a song of ascents those who trust in yahweh are as mount zion which can t be moved but remains forever 
as the mountains surround jerusalem so yahweh surrounds his people from this time forth and forevermore 
for the scepter of wickedness won t remain over the allotment of the righteous so that the righteous won t use their hands to do evil 
do good yahweh to those who are good to those who are upright in their hearts 
but as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity peace be on israel 
 a song of ascents when yahweh brought back those who returned to zion we were like those who dream 
then our mouth was filled with laughter and our tongue with singing then they said among the nations yahweh has done great things for them 
yahweh has done great things for us and we are glad 
restore our fortunes again yahweh like the streams in the negev 
those who sow in tears will reap in joy 
he who goes out weeping carrying seed for sowing will certainly come again with joy carrying his sheaves 
 a song of ascents by solomon unless yahweh builds the house they labor in vain who build it unless yahweh watches over the city the watchman guards it in vain 
it is vain for you to rise up early to stay up late eating the bread of toil for he gives sleep to his loved ones 
behold children are a heritage of yahweh the fruit of the womb is his reward 
as arrows in the hand of a mighty man so are the children of youth 
happy is the man who has his quiver full of them they won t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate 
 a song of ascents blessed is everyone who fears yahweh who walks in his ways 
for you will eat the labor of your hands you will be happy and it will be well with you 
your wife will be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house your children like olive plants around your table 
behold thus is the man blessed who fears yahweh 
may yahweh bless you out of zion and may you see the good of jerusalem all the days of your life 
yes may you see your children s children peace be upon israel 
 a song of ascents many times they have afflicted me from my youth up let israel now say 
many times they have afflicted me from my youth up yet they have not prevailed against me 
the plowers plowed on my back they made their furrows long 
yahweh is righteous he has cut apart the cords of the wicked 
let them be disappointed and turned backward all those who hate zion 
let them be as the grass on the housetops which withers before it grows up 
with which the reaper doesn t fill his hand nor he who binds sheaves his bosom 
neither do those who go by say the blessing of yahweh be on you we bless you in the name of yahweh 
 a song of ascents out of the depths i have cried to you yahweh 
lord hear my voice let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions 
if you yah kept a record of sins lord who could stand ?
but there is forgiveness with you therefore you are feared 
i wait for yahweh my soul waits i hope in his word 
my soul longs for the lord more than watchmen long for the morning more than watchmen for the morning 
israel hope in yahweh for with yahweh there is loving kindness with him is abundant redemption 
 a song of ascents by david yahweh my heart isn t haughty nor my eyes lofty nor do i concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me 
surely i have stilled and quieted my soul like a weaned child with his mother like a weaned child is my soul within me 
israel hope in yahweh from this time forth and forevermore 
 a song of ascents yahweh remember david and all his affliction 
how he swore to yahweh and vowed to the mighty one of jacob

though i walk in the midst of trouble you will revive me you will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies your right hand will save me 
yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me your loving kindness yahweh endures forever don t forsake the works of your own hands 
 for the chief musician a psalm by david yahweh you have searched me and you know me 
you know my sitting down and my rising up you perceive my thoughts from afar 
you search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways 
for there is not a word on my tongue but behold yahweh you know it altogether 
you hem me in behind and before you laid your hand on me 
this knowledge is beyond me it s lofty i can t attain it 
where could i go from your spirit ? or where could i flee from your presence ?
if i ascend up into heaven you are there if i make my bed in sheol behold you are there !
if i take the wings of the dawn and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea 
even there your hand will lead me and your right hand will hold me 
if i say surely the darkness will overwhelm me the light around me will be night 
even the darkness doesn t hide from you but the night shines as the day the darkness is like light to you 
for you formed my inmost being you knit me together in my mother s womb 
i will give thanks to you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful my soul knows that very well 
my frame wasn t hidden from you when i was made in secret woven together in the depths of the earth 
your eyes saw my body in your book they were all written the days that were ordained for me when as yet there were none of them 
how precious to me are your thoughts god ! how vast is their sum !
if i would count them they are more in number than the sand when i wake up i am still with you 
if only you god would kill the wicked get away from me you bloodthirsty men !
for they speak against you wickedly your enemies take your name in vain 
yahweh don t i hate those who hate you ? am i not grieved with those who rise up against you ?
i hate them with perfect hatred they have become my enemies 
search me god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts 
see if there is any wicked way in me and lead me in the everlasting way 
 for the chief musician a psalm by david deliver me yahweh from the evil man preserve me from the violent man 
those who devise mischief in their hearts they continually gather themselves together for war 
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent viper s poison is under their lips selah 
yahweh keep me from the hands of the wicked preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet 
the proud have hidden a snare for me they have spread the cords of a net by the path they have set traps for me selah 
i said to yahweh you are my god listen to the cry of my petitions yahweh 
yahweh the lord the strength of my salvation you have covered my head in the day of battle 
yahweh don t grant the desires of the wicked don t let their evil plans succeed or they will become proud selah 
as for the head of those who surround me let the mischief of their own lips cover them 
let burning coals fall on them let them be thrown into the fire into miry pits from where they never rise 
an evil speaker won t be established in the earth evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him 
i know that yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted and justice for the needy 
surely the righteous will give thanks to your name the upright will dwell in your presence 
 a psalm by david yahweh i have called on you come to me quickly ! listen to my voice when i call to you 
let my prayer be set before you like incense the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice 
set a watch yahweh before my mouth keep the door of my lips 
don t incline my heart to any evil thing to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity don t let me eat of their delicacies 
let the righteous strike me it is kindness let him reprove me it is like oil on the head don t let my head refuse it yet my prayer is always against evil deeds 
their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock they will hear my words for they are well spoken 
 as when one plows and breaks up the earth our bones are scattered at the mouth of sheol 
for my eyes are on you yahweh the lord in you i take refuge don t leave my soul destitute 
keep me from the snare which they have laid for me from the traps of the workers of iniquity 
let the wicked fall together into their own nets while i pass by 
 a contemplation by david when he was in the cave a prayer i cry with my voice to yahweh with my voice i ask yahweh for mercy 
i pour out my complaint before him i tell him my troubles 
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me you knew my path in the way in which i walk they have hidden a snare for me 
look on my right and see for there is no one who is concerned for me refuge has fled from me no one cares for my soul 
i cried to you yahweh i said you are my refuge my portion in the land of the living 
listen to my cry for i am in desperate need deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than me 
bring my soul out of prison that i may give thanks to your name the righteous will surround me for you will be good to me 
 a psalm by david hear my prayer yahweh listen to my petitions in your faithfulness and righteousness relieve me 
don t enter into judgment with your servant for in your sight no man living is righteous 
for the enemy pursues my soul he has struck my life down to the ground he has made me live in dark places as those who have been long dead 
therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate 
i remember the days of old i meditate on all your doings i contemplate the work of your hands 
i spread forth my hands to you my soul thirsts for you like a parched land selah 
hurry to answer me yahweh my spirit fails don t hide your face from me so that i don t become like those who go down into the pit 
cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning for i trust in you cause me to know the way in which i should walk for i lift up my soul to you 
deliver me yahweh from my enemies i flee to you to hide me 
teach me to do your will for you are my god your spirit is good lead me in the land of uprightness 
revive me yahweh for your name s sake in your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble 
in your loving kindness cut off my enemies and destroy all those who afflict my soul for i am your servant 
 by david blessed be yahweh my rock who teaches my hands to war and my fingers to battle 
my loving kindness my fortress my high tower my deliverer my shield and he in whom i take refuge who subdues my people under me 
yahweh what is man that you care for him ? or the son of man that you think of him ?
man is like a breath his days are like a shadow that passes away 
part your heavens yahweh and come down touch the mountains and they will smoke 
throw out lightning and scatter them send out your arrows and rout them 
stretch out your hand from above rescue me and deliver me out of great waters out of the hands of foreigners 
whose mouths speak deceit whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood 
i will sing a new song to you god on a ten stringed lyre i will sing praises to you 
you are he who gives salvation to kings who rescues david his servant from the deadly sword 
rescue me and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners whose mouths speak deceit whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood 
then our sons will be like well nurtured plants our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace 
our barns are full filled with all kinds of provision our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields

in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth 
now the earth was formless and empty darkness was on the surface of the deep god s spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters 
god said let there be light and there was light 
god saw the light and saw that it was good god divided the light from the darkness 
god called the light day and the darkness he called night there was evening and there was morning one day 
god said let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters 
god made the expanse and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse and it was so 
god called the expanse sky there was evening and there was morning a second day 
god said let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place and let the dry land appear and it was so 
god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters he called seas god saw that it was good 
god said let the earth yield grass herbs yielding seed and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind with its seed in it on the earth and it was so 
the earth yielded grass herbs yielding seed after their kind and trees bearing fruit with its seed in it after their kind and god saw that it was good 
there was evening and there was morning a third day 
god said let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years 
and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth and it was so 
god made the two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he also made the stars 
god set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth 
and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness god saw that it was good 
there was evening and there was morning a fourth day 
god said let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky 
god created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves with which the waters swarmed after their kind and every winged bird after its kind god saw that it was good 
god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let birds multiply on the earth 
there was evening and there was morning a fifth day 
god said let the earth produce living creatures after their kind livestock creeping things and animals of the earth after their kind and it was so 
god made the animals of the earth after their kind and the livestock after their kind and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind god saw that it was good 
god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth 
god created man in his own image in god s image he created him male and female he created them 
god blessed them god said to them be fruitful multiply fill the earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth 
god said behold i have given you every herb yielding seed which is on the surface of all the earth and every tree which bears fruit yielding seed it will be your food 
to every animal of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to everything that creeps on the earth in which there is life i have given every green herb for food and it was so 
god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good there was evening and there was morning a sixth day 
the heavens and the earth were finished and all their vast array 
on the seventh day god finished his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made 
god blessed the seventh day and made it holy because he rested in it from all his work which he had created and made 
this is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that yahweh god made the earth and the heavens 
no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up for yahweh god had not caused it to rain on the earth there was not a man to till the ground 
but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground 
yahweh god formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul 
yahweh god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed 
out of the ground yahweh god made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil 
a river went out of eden to water the garden and from there it was parted and became four heads 
the name of the first is pishon this is the one which flows through the whole land of havilah where there is gold 
and the gold of that land is good there is aromatic resin and the onyx stone 
the name of the second river is gihon the same river that flows through the whole land of cush 
the name of the third river is hiddekel this is the one which flows in front of assyria the fourth river is the euphrates 
yahweh god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it 
yahweh god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden you may freely eat 
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die 
yahweh god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a helper suitable for him 
out of the ground yahweh god formed every animal of the field and every bird of the sky and brought them to the man to see what he would call them whatever the man called every living creature that was its name 
the man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the sky and to every animal of the field but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him 
yahweh god caused a deep sleep to fall on the man and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place 
he made the rib which yahweh god had taken from the man into a woman and brought her to the man 
the man said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she will be called woman because she was taken out of man 
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and will join with his wife and they will be one flesh 
they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed 
now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which yahweh god had made he said to the woman has god really said you shall not eat of any tree of the garden ? 
the woman said to the serpent of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat 
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die 
the serpent said to the woman you won t surely die 
for god knows that in the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil 
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise she took of its fruit and ate and she gave some to her husband with her and he ate 
the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons 
they heard the voice of yahweh god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of yahweh god among the trees of the garden 
yahweh god called to the man and said to him where are you ? 
the man said i heard your voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself 
god said who told you that you were naked ? have you eaten from the tree that i commanded you not to eat from ? 
the man said the woman whom you gave to be with me she gave me of the tree and i ate 
yahweh god said to the woman what is this you have done ? the woman said the serpent deceived me and i ate 
yahweh god said to the serpent because you have done this you are cursed above all livestock and above every animal of the field on your belly you shall go and you shall eat dust all the days of your life 
i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring he will bruise your head and you will bruise his heel 
to the woman he said i will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth in pain you will bear children your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you 
to adam he said because you have listened to your wife s voice and have eaten of the tree of which i commanded you saying you shall not eat of it cursed is the ground for your sake in toil you will eat of it all the days of your life 
it will yield thorns and thistles to you and you will eat the herb of the field 
by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground for out of it you were taken for you are dust and to dust you shall return 
the man called his wife eve because she was the mother of all living 
yahweh god made coats of skins for adam and for his wife and clothed them 
yahweh god said behold the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil now lest he reach out his hand and also take of the tree of life and eat and live forever 
therefore yahweh god sent him out from the garden of eden to till the ground from which he was taken 
the man knew eve his wife she conceived and gave birth to cain and said i have gotten a man with yahweh s help 
again she gave birth to cain s brother abel abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground 
as time passed it happened that cain brought an offering to yahweh from the fruit of the ground 
abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat yahweh respected abel and his offering 
but he didn t respect cain and his offering cain was very angry and the expression on his face fell 
cain said to abel his brother let s go into the field it happened when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and killed him 
yahweh said to cain where is abel your brother ? he said i don t know am i my brother s keeper ? 
yahweh said what have you done ? the voice of your brother s blood cries to me from the ground 
now you are cursed because of the ground which has opened its mouth to receive your brother s blood from your hand 
from now on when you till the ground it won t yield its strength to you you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth 
cain said to yahweh my punishment is greater than i can bear 
behold you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground i will be hidden from your face and i will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me 
yahweh said to him therefore whoever slays cain vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold yahweh appointed a sign for cain lest any finding him should strike him 
cain went out from yahweh s presence and lived in the land of nod east of eden 
cain knew his wife she conceived and gave birth to enoch he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch 
to enoch was born irad irad became the father of mehujael mehujael became the father of methushael methushael became the father of lamech 
lamech took two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other zillah 
adah gave birth to jabal who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock 
his brother s name was jubal who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe 
zillah also gave birth to tubal cain the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron tubal cain s sister was naamah 
lamech said to his wives adah and zillah hear my voice you wives of lamech listen to my speech for i have slain a man for wounding me a young man for bruising me 
if cain will be avenged seven times truly lamech seventy seven times 
adam knew his wife again she gave birth to a son and named him seth for god has appointed me another child instead of abel for cain killed him 
there was also born a son to seth and he named him enosh then men began to call on yahweh s name 
this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man he made him in god s likeness 
he created them male and female and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created 
adam lived one hundred thirty years and became the father of a son in his own likeness after his image and named him seth 
the days of adam after he became the father of seth were eight hundred years and he became the father of sons and daughters 
all the days that adam lived were nine hundred thirty years then he died 
seth lived one hundred five years and became the father of enosh 
seth lived after he became the father of enosh eight hundred seven years and became the father of sons and daughters

it happened when men began to multiply on the surface of the ground and daughters were born to them 
that god s sons saw that men s daughters were beautiful and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose 
yahweh said my spirit will not strive with man forever because he also is flesh yet will his days be one hundred twenty years 
the nephilim were in the earth in those days and also after that when god s sons came in to men s daughters they bore children to them those were the mighty men who were of old men of renown 
yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually 
yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him in his heart 
yahweh said i will destroy man whom i have created from the surface of the ground man along with animals creeping things and birds of the sky for i am sorry that i have made them 
but noah found favor in yahweh s eyes 
this is the history of the generations of noah noah was a righteous man blameless among the people of his time noah walked with god 
noah became the father of three sons shem ham and japheth 
the earth was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence 
god saw the earth and saw that it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth 
god said to noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them behold i will destroy them with the earth 
make a ship of gopher wood you shall make rooms in the ship and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch 
this is how you shall make it the length of the ship will be three hundred cubits its breadth fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits 
you shall make a roof in the ship and you shall finish it to a cubit upward you shall set the door of the ship in its side you shall make it with lower second and third levels 
i even i do bring the flood of waters on this earth to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky everything that is in the earth will die 
but i will establish my covenant with you you shall come into the ship you your sons your wife and your sons wives with you 
of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every sort into the ship to keep them alive with you they shall be male and female 
of the birds after their kind of the livestock after their kind of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind two of every sort shall come to you to keep them alive 
take with you of all food that is eaten and gather it to yourself and it will be for food for you and for them 
thus noah did according to all that god commanded him so he did 
yahweh said to noah come with all of your household into the ship for i have seen your righteousness before me in this generation 
you shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you the male and his female of the animals that are not clean take two the male and his female 
also of the birds of the sky seven and seven male and female to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth 
in seven days i will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights every living thing that i have made i will destroy from the surface of the ground 
noah did everything that yahweh commanded him 
noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth 
noah went into the ship with his sons his wife and his sons wives because of the waters of the flood 
it happened after the seven days that the waters of the flood came on the earth 
in the six hundredth year of noah s life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the month on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open and the sky s windows were opened 
the rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights 
in the same day noah and shem ham and japheth the sons of noah and noah s wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered into the ship 
they and every animal after its kind all the livestock after their kind every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind and every bird after its kind every bird of every sort 
they went to noah into the ship by pairs of all flesh with the breath of life in them 
those who went in went in male and female of all flesh as god commanded him and yahweh shut him in 
the flood was forty days on the earth the waters increased and lifted up the ship and it was lifted up above the earth 
the waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth and the ship floated on the surface of the waters 
the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth all the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered 
the waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward and the mountains were covered 
every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground including man livestock creeping things and birds of the sky they were destroyed from the earth only noah was left and those who were with him in the ship 
the waters prevailed on the earth one hundred fifty days 
god remembered noah all the animals and all the livestock that were with him in the ship and god made a wind to pass over the earth the waters subsided 
the deep s fountains and the sky s windows were also stopped and the rain from the sky was restrained 
the waters receded from the earth continually after the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased 
the ship rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month on ararat s mountains 
the waters receded continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month the tops of the mountains were seen 
it happened at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ship which he had made 
and he sent out a raven it went back and forth until the waters were dried up from the earth 
he sent out a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground 
but the dove found no place to rest her foot and she returned to him into the ship for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth he put out his hand and took her and brought her to him into the ship 
he stayed yet another seven days and again he sent the dove out of the ship 
the dove came back to him at evening and behold in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off so noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth 
he stayed yet another seven days and sent out the dove and she didn t return to him any more 
it happened in the six hundred first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from the earth noah removed the covering of the ship and looked he saw that the surface of the ground was dried 
in the second month on the twenty seventh day of the month the earth was dry 
god spoke to noah saying 
 go out of the ship you and your wife and your sons and your sons wives with you 
bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh including birds livestock and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth 
noah went out with his sons his wife and his sons wives with him 
every animal every creeping thing and every bird whatever moves on the earth after their families went out of the ship 
noah built an altar to yahweh and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar 
yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma yahweh said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for man s sake because the imagination of man s heart is evil from his youth neither will i ever again strike everything living as i have done 
god blessed noah and his sons and said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth 
the fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth and on every bird of the sky everything that the ground teems with and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand 
every moving thing that lives will be food for you as the green herb i have given everything to you 
but flesh with its life its blood you shall not eat 
i will surely require your blood of your lives at the hand of every animal i will require it at the hand of man even at the hand of every man s brother i will require the life of man 
whoever sheds man s blood his blood will be shed by man for god made man in his own image 
be fruitful and multiply increase abundantly in the earth and multiply in it 
god spoke to noah and to his sons with him saying 
and with every living creature that is with you the birds the livestock and every animal of the earth with you of all that go out of the ship even every animal of the earth 
i will establish my covenant with you all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth 
god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations 
i set my rainbow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth 
it will happen when i bring a cloud over the earth that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud 
and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh 
the rainbow will be in the cloud i will look at it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth 
god said to noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth 
the sons of noah who went out from the ship were shem ham and japheth ham is the father of canaan 
these three were the sons of noah and from these the whole earth was populated 
noah began to be a farmer and planted a vineyard 
he drank of the wine and got drunk he was uncovered within his tent 
ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside 
shem and japheth took a garment and laid it on both their shoulders went in backwards and covered the nakedness of their father their faces were backwards and they didn t see their father s nakedness 
noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him 
he said canaan is cursed he will be servant of servants to his brothers 
he said blessed be yahweh the god of shem let canaan be his servant 
may god enlarge japheth let him dwell in the tents of shem let canaan be his servant 
noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood 
now this is the history of the generations of the sons of noah and of shem ham and japheth sons were born to them after the flood 
the sons of japheth gomer magog madai javan tubal meshech and tiras 
the sons of gomer ashkenaz riphath and togarmah 
the sons of javan elishah tarshish kittim and dodanim 
of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands everyone after his language after their families in their nations 
the sons of ham cush mizraim put and canaan 
the sons of cush seba havilah sabtah raamah and sabteca the sons of raamah sheba and dedan 
cush became the father of nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth 
he was a mighty hunter before yahweh therefore it is said like nimrod a mighty hunter before yahweh 
the beginning of his kingdom was babel erech accad and calneh in the land of shinar 
out of that land he went into assyria and built nineveh rehoboth ir calah 
and resen between nineveh and calah the same is the great city 
mizraim became the father of ludim anamim lehabim naphtuhim 
pathrusim casluhim which the philistines descended from and caphtorim 
canaan became the father of sidon his firstborn heth 
the jebusite the amorite the girgashite 
the hivite the arkite the sinite 
the arvadite the zemarite and the hamathite afterward the families of the canaanites were spread abroad 
the border of the canaanites was from sidon as you go toward gerar to gaza as you go toward sodom gomorrah admah and zeboiim to lasha 
these are the sons of ham after their families after their languages in their lands in their nations 
to shem the father of all the children of eber the elder brother of japheth to him also were children born 
the sons of shem elam asshur arpachshad lud and aram 
the sons of aram uz hul gether and mash 
arpachshad became the father of shelah shelah became the father of eber 
to eber were born two sons the name of the one was peleg for in his days the earth was divided his brother s name was joktan 
joktan became the father of almodad sheleph hazarmaveth jerah 
hadoram uzal diklah 
obal abimael sheba 
ophir havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan 
their dwelling was from mesha as you go toward sephar the mountain of the east 
these are the sons of shem after their families after their languages in their lands after their nations 
these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood 
the whole earth was of one language and of one speech 
it happened as they traveled east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they lived there 
they said one to another come let s make bricks and burn them thoroughly they had brick for stone and they used tar for mortar 
they said come let s build ourselves a city and a tower whose top reaches to the sky and let s make ourselves a name lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth 
yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built 
yahweh said behold they are one people and they have all one language and this is what they begin to do now nothing will be withheld from them which they intend to do 
come let s go down and there confuse their language that they may not understand one another s speech 
so yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth they stopped building the city 
therefore its name was called babel because there yahweh confused the language of all the earth from there yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth 
this is the history of the generations of shem shem was one hundred years old and became the father of arpachshad two years after the flood 
shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of arpachshad and became the father of sons and daughters 
arpachshad lived thirty five years and became the father of shelah 
arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of shelah and became the father of sons and daughters 
shelah lived thirty years and became the father of eber 
and shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of eber and became the father of sons and daughters 
eber lived thirty four years and became the father of peleg 
eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of peleg and became the father of sons and daughters 
peleg lived thirty years and became the father of reu 
peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of reu and became the father of sons and daughters 
reu lived thirty two years and became the father of serug 
reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of serug and became the father of sons and daughters 
serug lived thirty years and became the father of nahor 
serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of nahor and became the father of sons and daughters 
nahor lived twenty nine years and became the father of terah 
nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of terah and became the father of sons and daughters 
terah lived seventy years and became the father of abram nahor and haran 
now this is the history of the generations of terah terah became the father of abram nahor and haran haran became the father of lot 
haran died before his father terah in the land of his birth in ur of the chaldees 
abram and nahor took wives the name of abram s wife was sarai and the name of nahor s wife milcah the daughter of haran who was also the father of iscah 
sarai was barren she had no child 
terah took abram his son lot the son of haran his son s son and sarai his daughter in law his son abram s wife they went from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan they came to haran and lived there 
the days of terah were two hundred five years terah died in haran 
now yahweh said to abram get out of your country and from your relatives and from your father s house to the land that i will show you 
i will make of you a great nation i will bless you and make your name great you will be a blessing 
i will bless those who bless you and i will curse him who curses you all of the families of the earth will be blessed in you 
so abram went as yahweh had spoken to him lot went with him abram was seventy five years old when he departed out of haran 
abram took sarai his wife lot his brother s son all their substance that they had gathered and the souls whom they had gotten in haran and they went to go into the land of canaan into the land of canaan they came 
abram passed through the land to the place of shechem to the oak of moreh the canaanite was then in the land 
yahweh appeared to abram and said i will give this land to your seed he built an altar there to yahweh who appeared to him 
he left from there to the mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and ai on the east there he built an altar to yahweh and called on the name of yahweh 
abram traveled going on still toward the south 
there was a famine in the land abram went down into egypt to live as a foreigner there for the famine was severe in the land 
it happened when he had come near to enter egypt that he said to sarai his wife see now i know that you are a beautiful woman to look at 
it will happen when the egyptians will see you that they will say this is his wife they will kill me but they will save you alive 
please say that you are my sister that it may be well with me for your sake and that my soul may live because of you 
it happened that when abram had come into egypt the egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful 
the princes of pharaoh saw her and praised her to pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaoh s house 
he dealt well with abram for her sake he had sheep cattle male donkeys male servants female servants female donkeys and camels 
yahweh plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abram s wife 
pharaoh called abram and said what is this that you have done to me ? why didn t you tell me that she was your wife ?
why did you say she is my sister so that i took her to be my wife ? now therefore see your wife take her and go your way 
pharaoh commanded men concerning him and they brought him on the way with his wife and all that he had 
abram went up out of egypt he his wife all that he had and lot with him into the south 
abram was very rich in livestock in silver and in gold 
he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and ai 
to the place of the altar which he had made there at the first there abram called on the name of yahweh 
lot also who went with abram had flocks and herds and tents 
the land was not able to bear them that they might live together for their substance was great so that they could not live together 
there was a strife between the herdsmen of abram s livestock and the herdsmen of lot s livestock and the canaanite and the perizzite lived in the land at that time 
abram said to lot please let there be no strife between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen for we are relatives 
isn t the whole land before you ? please separate yourself from me if you go to the left hand then i will go to the right or if you go to the right hand then i will go to the left 
lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the plain of the jordan that it was well watered everywhere before yahweh destroyed sodom and gomorrah like the garden of yahweh like the land of egypt as you go to zoar 
so lot chose the plain of the jordan for himself lot traveled east and they separated themselves the one from the other 
abram lived in the land of canaan and lot lived in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as sodom 
now the men of sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against yahweh 
yahweh said to abram after lot was separated from him now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are northward and southward and eastward and westward 
for all the land which you see i will give to you and to your offspring forever 
i will make your offspring as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then your seed may also be numbered 
arise walk through the land in its length and in its breadth for i will give it to you 
abram moved his tent and came and lived by the oaks of mamre which are in hebron and built an altar there to yahweh 
it happened in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim 
that they made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar 
all these joined together in the valley of siddim the same is the salt sea 
twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled 
in the fourteenth year chedorlaomer came and the kings who were with him and struck the rephaim in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzim in ham and the emim in shaveh kiriathaim 
and the horites in their mount seir to elparan which is by the wilderness 
they returned and came to en mishpat the same is kadesh and struck all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that lived in hazazon tamar 
the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar went out and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of siddim 
against chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings against the five 
now the valley of siddim was full of tar pits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and they fell there and those who remained fled to the hills 
they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their food and went their way 
they took lot abram s brother s son who lived in sodom and his goods and departed 
one who had escaped came and told abram the hebrew now he lived by the oaks of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were allies of abram 
when abram heard that his relative was taken captive he led out his trained men born in his house three hundred and eighteen and pursued as far as dan 
he divided himself against them by night he and his servants and struck them and pursued them to hobah which is on the left hand of damascus 
he brought back all the goods and also brought back his relative lot and his goods and the women also and the people 
the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him at the valley of shaveh that is the king s valley 
melchizedek king of salem brought out bread and wine and he was priest of god most high 
he blessed him and said blessed be abram of god most high possessor of heaven and earth 
and blessed be god most high who has delivered your enemies into your hand abram gave him a tenth of all 
the king of sodom said to abram give me the people and take the goods to yourself 
abram said to the king of sodom i have lifted up my hand to yahweh god most high possessor of heaven and earth 
that i will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours lest you should say i have made abram rich 
i will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men who went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion 
after these things the word of yahweh came to abram in a vision saying don t be afraid abram i am your shield your exceedingly great reward 
abram said lord yahweh what will you give me since i go childless and he who will inherit my estate is eliezer of damascus ? 
abram said behold to me you have given no seed and behold one born in my house is my heir 
behold the word of yahweh came to him saying this man will not be your heir but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir 
yahweh brought him outside and said look now toward the sky and count the stars if you are able to count them he said to abram so shall your seed be 
he believed in yahweh and he reckoned it to him for righteousness 
he said to him i am yahweh who brought you out of ur of the chaldees to give you this land to inherit it 
he said lord yahweh how will i know that i will inherit it ? 
he said to him bring me a heifer three years old a female goat three years old a ram three years old a turtledove and a young pigeon 
he brought him all of these and divided them in the middle and laid each half opposite the other but he didn t divide the birds 
the birds of prey came down on the carcasses and abram drove them away 
when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell on abram now terror and great darkness fell on him 
he said to abram know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs and will serve them they will afflict them four hundred years 
i will also judge that nation whom they will serve afterward they will come out with great wealth 
but you will go to your fathers in peace you will be buried in a good old age 
in the fourth generation they will come here again for the iniquity of the amorite is not yet full 
it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between these pieces 
in that day yahweh made a covenant with abram saying to your seed i have given this land from the river of egypt to the great river the river euphrates 
the kenites the kenizzites the kadmonites 
the hittites the perizzites the rephaim 
the amorites the canaanites the girgashites and the jebusites 
now sarai abram s wife bore him no children she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar 
sarai said to abram see now yahweh has restrained me from bearing please go in to my handmaid it may be that i will obtain children by her abram listened to the voice of sarai 
sarai abram s wife took hagar the egyptian her handmaid after abram had lived ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to abram her husband to be his wife 
he went in to hagar and she conceived when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes 
sarai said to abram this wrong is your fault i gave my handmaid into your bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes yahweh judge between me and you 
but abram said to sarai behold your maid is in your hand do to her whatever is good in your eyes sarai dealt harshly with her and she fled from her face 
the angel of yahweh found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur 
he said hagar sarai s handmaid where did you come from ? where are you going ? she said i am fleeing from the face of my mistress sarai 
the angel of yahweh said to her return to your mistress and submit yourself under her hands 
the angel of yahweh said to her i will greatly multiply your seed that they will not be numbered for multitude 
the angel of yahweh said to her behold you are with child and will bear a son you shall call his name ishmael because yahweh has heard your affliction 
he will be like a wild donkey among men his hand will be against every man and every man s hand against him he will live opposite all of his brothers 
she called the name of yahweh who spoke to her you are a god who sees for she said have i even stayed alive after seeing him ? 
therefore the well was called beer lahai roi behold it is between kadesh and bered 
hagar bore a son for abram abram called the name of his son whom hagar bore ishmael 
abram was eighty six years old when hagar bore ishmael to abram 
when abram was ninety nine years old yahweh appeared to abram and said to him i am god almighty walk before me and be blameless 
i will make my covenant between me and you and will multiply you exceedingly 
abram fell on his face god talked with him saying 
 as for me behold my covenant is with you you will be the father of a multitude of nations 
neither will your name any more be called abram but your name will be abraham for i have made you the father of a multitude of nations 
i will make you exceedingly fruitful and i will make nations of you kings will come out of you 
i will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god to you and to your seed after you 
i will give to you and to your seed after you the land where you are traveling all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession i will be their god 
god said to abraham as for you you will keep my covenant you and your seed after you throughout their generations 
this is my covenant which you shall keep between me and you and your seed after you every male among you shall be circumcised 
you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin it will be a token of the covenant between me and you 
he who is eight days old will be circumcised among you every male throughout your generations he who is born in the house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed 
he who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised my covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant 
the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin that soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant 
god said to abraham as for sarai your wife you shall not call her name sarai but her name will be sarah 
i will bless her and moreover i will give you a son by her yes i will bless her and she will be a mother of nations kings of peoples will come from her 
then abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old ? will sarah who is ninety years old give birth ? 
abraham said to god oh that ishmael might live before you ! 
god said no but sarah your wife will bear you a son you shall call his name isaac i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him 
as for ishmael i have heard you behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly he will become the father of twelve princes and i will make him a great nation 
but my covenant i establish with isaac whom sarah will bear to you at this set time next year 
when he finished talking with him god went up from abraham 
abraham took ishmael his son all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money every male among the men of abraham s house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day as god had said to him 
abraham was ninety nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin 
yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of mamre as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day 
he lifted up his eyes and looked and saw that three men stood opposite him when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the earth 
and said my lord if now i have found favor in your sight please don t go away from your servant 
now let a little water be fetched wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree 
i will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart after that you may go your way now that you have come to your servant they said very well do as you have said 
abraham hurried into the tent to sarah and said quickly prepare three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes 
abraham ran to the herd and fetched a tender and good calf and gave it to the servant he hurried to dress it 
he took butter milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them he stood by them under the tree and they ate 
they asked him where is sarah your wife ? he said see in the tent 
he said i will certainly return to you when the season comes round behold sarah your wife will have a son sarah heard in the tent door which was behind him 
now abraham and sarah were old well advanced in age sarah had passed the age of childbearing 
sarah laughed within herself saying after i have grown old will i have pleasure my lord being old also ? 
yahweh said to abraham why did sarah laugh saying will i really bear a child yet i am old ? 
is anything too hard for yahweh ? at the set time i will return to you when the season comes round and sarah will have a son 
then sarah denied saying i didn t laugh for she was afraid he said no but you did laugh 
the men rose up from there and looked toward sodom abraham went with them to see them on their way 
yahweh said will i hide from abraham what i do 
since abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him ?
for i have known him to the end that he may command his children and his household after him that they may keep the way of yahweh to do righteousness and justice to the end that yahweh may bring on abraham that which he has spoken of him 
yahweh said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous 
i will go down now and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me if not i will know 
the men turned from there and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before yahweh 
abraham drew near and said will you consume the righteous with the wicked ?
what if there are fifty righteous within the city ? will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it ?
be it far from you to do things like that to kill the righteous with the wicked so that the righteous should be like the wicked may that be far from you shouldn t the judge of all the earth do right ? 
yahweh said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sake 
abraham answered see now i have taken it on myself to speak to the lord who am but dust and ashes 
what if there will lack five of the fifty righteous ? will you destroy all the city for lack of five ? he said i will not destroy it if i find forty five there 
he spoke to him yet again and said what if there are forty found there ? he said i will not do it for the forty s sake 
he said oh don t let the lord be angry and i will speak what if there are thirty found there ? he said i will not do it if i find thirty there 
he said see now i have taken it on myself to speak to the lord what if there are twenty found there ? he said i will not destroy it for the twenty s sake 
he said oh don t let the lord be angry and i will speak just once more what if ten are found there ? he said i will not destroy it for the ten s sake 
yahweh went his way as soon as he had finished communing with abraham and abraham returned to his place 
the two angels came to sodom at evening lot sat in the gate of sodom lot saw them and rose up to meet them he bowed himself with his face to the earth 
and he said see now my lords please turn aside into your servant s house stay all night wash your feet and you can rise up early and go on your way they said no but we will stay in the street all night 
he urged them greatly and they came in with him and entered into his house he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread and they ate 
but before they lay down the men of the city the men of sodom surrounded the house both young and old all the people from every quarter 
they called to lot and said to him where are the men who came in to you this night ? bring them out to us that we may have sex with them 
lot went out to them to the door and shut the door after him 
he said please my brothers don t act so wickedly 
see now i have two virgin daughters please let me bring them out to you and you may do to them what seems good to you only don t do anything to these men because they have come under the shadow of my roof 
they said stand back ! then they said this one fellow came in to live as a foreigner and he appoints himself a judge now will we deal worse with you than with them ! they pressed hard on the man lot and drew near to break the door 
but the men reached out their hand and brought lot into the house to them and shut the door 
they struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door 
the men said to lot do you have anybody else here ? sons in law your sons your daughters and whoever you have in the city bring them out of the place 
for we will destroy this place because the outcry against them has grown great before yahweh that yahweh has sent us to destroy it 
lot went out and spoke to his sons in law who were pledged to marry his daughters and said get up ! get out of this place for yahweh will destroy the city but he seemed to his sons in law to be joking 
when the morning came then the angels hurried lot saying get up ! take your wife and your two daughters who are here lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city 
but he lingered and the men grabbed his hand his wife s hand and his two daughters hands yahweh being merciful to him and they took him out and set him outside of the city 
it came to pass when they had taken them out that he said escape for your life ! don t look behind you and don t stay anywhere in the plain escape to the mountains lest you be consumed ! 
lot said to them oh not so my lord 
see now your servant has found favor in your sight and you have magnified your loving kindness which you have shown to me in saving my life i can t escape to the mountain lest evil overtake me and i die 
see now this city is near to flee to and it is a little one oh let me escape there isn t it a little one ? and my soul will live 
he said to him behold i have granted your request concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken 
hurry escape there for i can t do anything until you get there therefore the name of the city was called zoar 
the sun had risen on the earth when lot came to zoar 
then yahweh rained on sodom and on gomorrah sulfur and fire from yahweh out of the sky 
he overthrew those cities all the plain all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew on the ground 
but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt 
abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before yahweh 
he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and looked and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace 
it happened when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot lived 
lot went up out of zoar and lived in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he was afraid to live in zoar he lived in a cave with his two daughters 
the firstborn said to the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth 
come let s make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve our father s seed 
they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father he didn t know when she lay down nor when she arose 
it came to pass on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger behold i lay last night with my father let us make him drink wine again tonight you go in and lie with him that we may preserve our father s seed 
they made their father drink wine that night also the younger went and lay with him he didn t know when she lay down nor when she got up 
thus both of lot s daughters were with child by their father 
the firstborn bore a son and named him moab he is the father of the moabites to this day 
the younger also bore a son and called his name ben ammi he is the father of the children of ammon to this day 
abraham traveled from there toward the land of the south and lived between kadesh and shur he lived as a foreigner in gerar 
abraham said about sarah his wife she is my sister abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah 
but god came to abimelech in a dream of the night and said to him behold you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken for she is a man s wife 
now abimelech had not come near her he said lord will you kill even a righteous nation ?
didn t he tell me she is my sister ? she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have i done this 
god said to him in the dream yes i know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this and i also withheld you from sinning against me therefore i didn t allow you to touch her 
now therefore restore the man s wife for he is a prophet and he will pray for you and you will live if you don t restore her know for sure that you will die you and all who are yours 
abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ear the men were very scared 
then abimelech called abraham and said to him what have you done to us ? how have i sinned against you that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin ? you have done deeds to me that ought not to be done ! 
abimelech said to abraham what did you see that you have done this thing ? 
abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place they will kill me for my wife s sake 
besides she is indeed my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife 
it happened when god caused me to wander from my father s house that i said to her this is your kindness which you shall show to me everywhere that we go say of me he is my brother 
abimelech took sheep and cattle male servants and female servants and gave them to abraham and restored sarah his wife to him 
abimelech said behold my land is before you dwell where it pleases you 
to sarah he said behold i have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver behold it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you in front of all you are vindicated 
abraham prayed to god god healed abimelech and his wife and his female servants and they bore children 
for yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abraham s wife 
yahweh visited sarah as he had said and yahweh did to sarah as he had spoken 
sarah conceived and bore abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him 
abraham called his son who was born to him whom sarah bore to him isaac 
abraham circumcised his son isaac when he was eight days old as god had commanded him 
abraham was one hundred years old when his son isaac was born to him 
sarah said god has made me laugh everyone who hears will laugh with me 
she said who would have said to abraham that sarah would nurse children ? for i have borne him a son in his old age 
the child grew and was weaned abraham made a great feast on the day that isaac was weaned 
sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian whom she had borne to abraham mocking 
therefore she said to abraham cast out this handmaid and her son ! for the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son isaac 
the thing was very grievous in abraham s sight on account of his son 
god said to abraham don t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy and because of your handmaid in all that sarah says to you listen to her voice for from isaac will your seed be called 
i will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid because he is your seed 
abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it to hagar putting it on her shoulder and gave her the child and sent her away she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba 
the water in the bottle was spent and she cast the child under one of the shrubs 
she went and sat down opposite him a good way off about a bow shot away for she said don t let me see the death of the child she sat over against him and lifted up her voice and wept 
god heard the voice of the boy the angel of god called to hagar out of the sky and said to her what ails you hagar ? don t be afraid for god has heard the voice of the boy where he is 
get up lift up the boy and hold him in your hand for i will make him a great nation 
god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water she went filled the bottle with water and gave the boy drink 
god was with the boy and he grew he lived in the wilderness and became as he grew up an archer 
he lived in the wilderness of paran his mother took a wife for him out of the land of egypt 
it happened at that time that abimelech and phicol the captain of his army spoke to abraham saying god is with you in all that you do 
now therefore swear to me here by god that you will not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my son s son but according to the kindness that i have done to you you shall do to me and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner 
abraham said i will swear 
abraham complained to abimelech because of a water well which abimelech s servants had violently taken away 
abimelech said i don t know who has done this thing you didn t tell me neither did i hear of it until today 
abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to abimelech those two made a covenant 
abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves 
abimelech said to abraham what do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean ? 
he said you shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand that it may be a witness to me that i have dug this well 
therefore he called that place beersheba because they both swore there 
so they made a covenant at beersheba abimelech rose up with phicol the captain of his army and they returned into the land of the philistines 
abraham planted a tamarisk tree in beersheba and called there on the name of yahweh the everlasting god 
it happened after these things that god tested abraham and said to him abraham ! he said here i am 
he said now take your son your only son whom you love even isaac and go into the land of moriah offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which i will tell you of 
abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son he split the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went to the place of which god had told him 
on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place far off 
abraham said to his young men stay here with the donkey the boy and i will go yonder we will worship and come back to you 
abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on isaac his son he took in his hand the fire and the knife they both went together 
isaac spoke to abraham his father and said my father ? he said here i am my son he said here is the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ? 
abraham said god will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering my son so they both went together 
they came to the place which god had told him of abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar on the wood 
abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to kill his son 
the angel of yahweh called to him out of the sky and said abraham abraham ! he said here i am 
he said don t lay your hand on the boy neither do anything to him for now i know that you fear god since you have not withheld your son your only son from me 
abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son 
abraham called the name of that place yahweh will provide as it is said to this day on yahweh s mountain it will be provided 
the angel of yahweh called to abraham a second time out of the sky 
and said i have sworn by myself says yahweh because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son your only son 
that i will bless you greatly and i will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore your seed will possess the gate of his enemies 
in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed because you have obeyed my voice 
so abraham returned to his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba abraham lived at beersheba 
it happened after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she also has borne children to your brother nahor 
uz his firstborn buz his brother kemuel the father of aram 
chesed hazo pildash jidlaph and bethuel 
bethuel became the father of rebekah these eight milcah bore to nahor abraham s brother 
his concubine whose name was reumah also bore tebah gaham tahash and maacah 
sarah lived one hundred twenty seven years this was the length of sarah s life 
sarah died in kiriath arba the same is hebron in the land of canaan abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her 
abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke to the children of heth saying 
 i am a stranger and a foreigner living with you give me a possession of a burying place with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight 
the children of heth answered abraham saying to him 
 hear us my lord you are a prince of god among us bury your dead in the best of our tombs none of us will withhold from you his tomb bury your dead 
abraham rose up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth 
he talked with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and entreat for me to ephron the son of zohar 
that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he has which is in the end of his field for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying place 
now ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of heth ephron the hittite answered abraham in the hearing of the children of heth even of all who went in at the gate of his city saying 
 no my lord hear me i give you the field and i give you the cave that is in it in the presence of the children of my people i give it to you bury your dead 
abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land 
he spoke to ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if you will please hear me i will give the price of the field take it from me and i will bury my dead there 
ephron answered abraham saying to him 
 my lord listen to me what is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you ? therefore bury your dead 
abraham listened to ephron abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of heth four hundred shekels of silver according to the current merchants standard 
after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre that is hebron in the land of canaan 
the field and the cave that is in it were deeded to abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of heth 
abraham was old and well stricken in age yahweh had blessed abraham in all things 
abraham said to his servant the elder of his house who ruled over all that he had please put your hand under my thigh 
i will make you swear by yahweh the god of heaven and the god of the earth that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i live 
but you shall go to my country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son isaac 
the servant said to him what if the woman isn t willing to follow me to this land ? must i bring your son again to the land you came from ? 
abraham said to him beware that you don t bring my son there again 
yahweh the god of heaven who took me from my father s house and from the land of my birth who spoke to me and who swore to me saying i will give this land to your seed he will send his angel before you and you shall take a wife for my son from there 
if the woman isn t willing to follow you then you shall be clear from this my oath only you shall not bring my son there again 
the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter 
the servant took ten camels of his master s camels and departed having a variety of good things of his master s with him he arose and went to mesopotamia to the city of nahor 
he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening the time that women go out to draw water 
he said yahweh the god of my master abraham please give me success this day and show kindness to my master abraham 
behold i am standing by the spring of water the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water 
let it happen that the young lady to whom i will say please let down your pitcher that i may drink 
and she will say 
 drink and i will also give your camels a drink 
let her be the one you have appointed for your servant isaac 
by this i will know that you have shown kindness to my master 
it happened before he had finished speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel the son of milcah the wife of nahor abraham s brother with her pitcher on her shoulder 
the young lady was very beautiful to look at a virgin neither had any man known her she went down to the spring filled her pitcher and came up 
the servant ran to meet her and said please give me a drink a little water from your pitcher 
she said drink my lord she hurried and let down her pitcher on her hand and gave him drink 
when she had done giving him drink she said i will also draw for your camels until they have done drinking 
she hurried and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again to the well to draw and drew for all his camels 
the man looked steadfastly at her remaining silent to know whether yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not 
it happened as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold 
and said whose daughter are you ? please tell me is there room in your father s house for us to lodge in ? 
she said to him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah whom she bore to nahor 
she said moreover to him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in 
the man bowed his head and worshiped yahweh 
he said blessed be yahweh the god of my master abraham who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master as for me yahweh has led me in the way to the house of my master s relatives 
the young lady ran and told her mother s house about these words 
rebekah had a brother and his name was laban laban ran out to the man to the spring 
it happened when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister s hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying this is what the man said to me that he came to the man behold he was standing by the camels at the spring 
he said come in you blessed of yahweh why do you stand outside ? for i have prepared the house and room for the camels 
the man came into the house and he unloaded the camels he gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him 
food was set before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told my message he said speak on 
he said i am abraham s servant 
yahweh has blessed my master greatly he has become great he has given him flocks and herds silver and gold male servants and female servants and camels and donkeys 
sarah my master s wife bore a son to my master when she was old he has given all that he has to him 
my master made me swear saying you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i live 
but you shall go to my father s house and to my relatives and take a wife for my son 
i asked my master what if the woman will not follow me ? 
he said to me yahweh before whom i walk will send his angel with you and prosper your way you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives and of my father s house 
then will you be clear from my oath when you come to my relatives if they don t give her to you you shall be clear from my oath 
i came this day to the spring and said yahweh the god of my master abraham if now you do prosper my way which i go 
behold i am standing by this spring of water let it happen that the maiden who comes out to draw to whom i will say please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink 
and she will tell me drink and i will also draw for your camels let her be the woman whom yahweh has appointed for my master s son 
before i had finished speaking in my heart behold rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder she went down to the spring and drew i said to her please let me drink 
she hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will also give your camels a drink so i drank and she also gave the camels a drink 
i asked her and said whose daughter are you ? she said the daughter of bethuel nahor s son whom milcah bore to him i put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her hands 
i bowed my head and worshiped yahweh and blessed yahweh the god of my master abraham who had led me in the right way to take my master s brother s daughter for his son 
now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left 
then laban and bethuel answered the thing proceeds from yahweh we can t speak to you bad or good 
behold rebekah is before you take her and go and let her be your master s son s wife as yahweh has spoken 
it happened that when abraham s servant heard their words he bowed himself down to the earth to yahweh 
the servant brought out jewels of silver and jewels of gold and clothing and gave them to rebekah he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother 
they ate and drank he and the men who were with him and stayed all night they rose up in the morning and he said send me away to my master 
her brother and her mother said let the young lady stay with us a few days at least ten after that she will go 
he said to them don t hinder me since yahweh has prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master 
they said we will call the young lady and ask her 
they called rebekah and said to her will you go with this man ? she said i will go 
they sent away rebekah their sister with her nurse abraham s servant and his men 
they blessed rebekah and said to her our sister may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them 
rebekah arose with her ladies they rode on the camels and followed the man the servant took rebekah and went his way 
isaac came from the way of beer lahai roi for he lived in the land of the south 
isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold there were camels coming 
rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she dismounted from the camel 
she said to the servant who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us ? the servant said it is my master she took her veil and covered herself 
the servant told isaac all the things that he had done 
isaac brought her into his mother sarah s tent and took rebekah and she became his wife he loved her isaac was comforted after his mother s death 
abraham took another wife and her name was keturah 
she bore him zimran jokshan medan midian ishbak and shuah 
jokshan became the father of sheba and dedan the sons of dedan were asshurim letushim and leummim 
the sons of midian ephah epher hanoch abida and eldaah all these were the children of keturah 
these are the days of the years of abraham s life which he lived one hundred seventy five years 
abraham gave up the spirit and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people 
isaac and ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre 
the field which abraham purchased of the children of heth abraham was buried there with sarah his wife 
it happened after the death of abraham that god blessed isaac his son isaac lived by beer lahai roi 
now this is the history of the generations of ishmael abraham s son whom hagar the egyptian sarah s handmaid bore to abraham 
these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to the order of their birth the firstborn of ishmael nebaioth then kedar adbeel mibsam 
mishma dumah massa 
hadad tema jetur naphish and kedemah 
these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments twelve princes according to their nations 
these are the years of the life of ishmael one hundred thirty seven years he gave up the spirit and died and was gathered to his people 
they lived from havilah to shur that is before egypt as you go toward assyria he lived opposite all his relatives 
this is the history of the generations of isaac abraham s son abraham became the father of isaac 
isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah the daughter of bethuel the syrian of paddan aram the sister of laban the syrian to be his wife 
isaac entreated yahweh for his wife because she was barren yahweh was entreated by him and rebekah his wife conceived 
the children struggled together within her she said if it be so why do i live ? she went to inquire of yahweh 
yahweh said to her two nations are in your womb two peoples will be separated from your body the one people will be stronger than the other people the elder will serve the younger 
when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb 
the first came out red all over like a hairy garment they named him esau 
after that his brother came out and his hand had hold on esau s heel he was named jacob isaac was sixty years old when she bore them 
the boys grew esau was a skillful hunter a man of the field jacob was a quiet man living in tents 
now isaac loved esau because he ate his venison rebekah loved jacob 
jacob boiled stew esau came in from the field and he was famished 
esau said to jacob please feed me with that same red stew for i am famished therefore his name was called edom 
jacob said first sell me your birthright 
esau said behold i am about to die what good is the birthright to me ? 
jacob said swear to me first he swore to him he sold his birthright to jacob 
jacob gave esau bread and stew of lentils he ate and drank rose up and went his way so esau despised his birthright 
there was a famine in the land besides the first famine that was in the days of abraham isaac went to abimelech king of the philistines to gerar 
yahweh appeared to him and said don t go down into egypt live in the land i will tell you about 
live in this land and i will be with you and will bless you for to you and to your seed i will give all these lands and i will establish the oath which i swore to abraham your father 
i will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky and will give to your seed all these lands in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed 
because abraham obeyed my voice and kept my requirements my commandments my statutes and my laws 
isaac lived in gerar 
the men of the place asked him about his wife he said she is my sister for he was afraid to say my wife lest he thought the men of the place might kill me for rebekah because she is beautiful to look at 
it happened when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was caressing rebekah his wife 
abimelech called isaac and said behold surely she is your wife why did you say she is my sister ? isaac said to him because i said lest i die because of her 
abimelech said what is this you have done to us ? one of the people might easily have lain with your wife and you would have brought guilt on us ! 
abimelech commanded all the people saying he who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death 
isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted yahweh blessed him 
the man grew great and grew more and more until he became very great 
he had possessions of flocks possessions of herds and a great household the philistines envied him 
now all the wells which his father s servants had dug in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped and filled with earth 
abimelech said to isaac go from us for you are much mightier than we 
isaac departed from there encamped in the valley of gerar and lived there 
isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham he called their names after the names by which his father had called them 
isaac s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of springing water 
the herdsmen of gerar argued with isaac s herdsmen saying the water is ours he called the name of the well esek because they contended with him 
they dug another well and they argued over that also he called its name sitnah 
he left that place and dug another well they didn t argue over that one he called it rehoboth he said for now yahweh has made room for us and we will be fruitful in the land 
he went up from there to beersheba 
yahweh appeared to him the same night and said i am the god of abraham your father don t be afraid for i am with you and will bless you and multiply your seed for my servant abraham s sake 
he built an altar there and called on the name of yahweh and pitched his tent there there isaac s servants dug a well 
then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath his friend and phicol the captain of his army 
isaac said to them why have you come to me since you hate me and have sent me away from you ? 
they said we saw plainly that yahweh was with you we said let there now be an oath between us even between us and you and let us make a covenant with you 
that you will do us no harm as we have not touched you and as we have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace you are now the blessed of yahweh 
he made them a feast and they ate and drank 
they rose up some time in the morning and swore one to another isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace 
it happened the same day that isaac s servants came and told him concerning the well which they had dug and said to him we have found water 
he called it shibah therefore the name of the city is beersheba to this day 
when esau was forty years old he took as wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite 
it happened that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his elder son and said to him my son ? he said to him here i am 
he said see now i am old i don t know the day of my death 
now therefore please take your weapons your quiver and your bow and go out to the field and take me venison 
make me savory food such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat and that my soul may bless you before i die 
rebekah heard when isaac spoke to esau his son esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it 
rebekah spoke to jacob her son saying behold i heard your father speak to esau your brother saying 
 bring me venison and make me savory food that i may eat and bless you before yahweh before my death 
now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command you 
go now to the flock and get me from there two good young goats i will make them savory food for your father such as he loves 
you shall bring it to your father that he may eat so that he may bless you before his death 
jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man 
what if my father touches me ? i will seem to him as a deceiver and i would bring a curse on myself and not a blessing 
his mother said to him let your curse be on me my son only obey my voice and go get them for me 
he went and got them and brought them to his mother his mother made savory food such as his father loved 
rebekah took the good clothes of esau her elder son which were with her in the house and put them on jacob her younger son 
she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth of his neck 
she gave the savory food and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob 
he came to his father and said my father ? he said here i am who are you my son ? 
jacob said to his father i am esau your firstborn i have done what you asked me to do please arise sit and eat of my venison that your soul may bless me 
isaac said to his son how is it that you have found it so quickly my son ? he said because yahweh your god gave me success 
isaac said to jacob please come near that i may feel you my son whether you are really my son esau or not 
jacob went near to isaac his father he felt him and said the voice is jacob s voice but the hands are the hands of esau 
he didn t recognize him because his hands were hairy like his brother esau s hands so he blessed him 
he said are you really my son esau ? he said i am 
he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my son s venison that my soul may bless you he brought it near to him and he ate he brought him wine and he drank 
his father isaac said to him come near now and kiss me my son 
he came near and kissed him he smelled the smell of his clothing and blessed him and said behold the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which yahweh has blessed 
god give you of the dew of the sky of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and new wine 
let peoples serve you and nations bow down to you be lord over your brothers let your mother s sons bow down to you cursed be everyone who curses you blessed be everyone who blesses you 
it happened as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob had just gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting 
he also made savory food and brought it to his father he said to his father let my father arise and eat of his son s venison that your soul may bless me 
isaac his father said to him who are you ? he said i am your son your firstborn esau 
isaac trembled violently and said who then is he who has taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before you came and have blessed him ? yes he will be blessed 
when esau heard the words of his father he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry and said to his father bless me even me also my father 
he said your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing 
he said isn t he rightly named jacob ? for he has supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright see now he has taken away my blessing he said haven t you reserved a blessing for me ? 
isaac answered esau behold i have made him your lord and all his brothers have i given to him for servants with grain and new wine have i sustained him what then will i do for you my son ? 
esau said to his father have you but one blessing my father ? bless me even me also my father esau lifted up his voice and wept 
isaac his father answered him behold of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling and of the dew of the sky from above 
by your sword will you live and you will serve your brother it will happen when you will break loose that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck 
esau hated jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then i will kill my brother jacob 
the words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah she sent and called jacob her younger son and said to him behold your brother esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you 
now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee to laban my brother in haran 
stay with him a few days until your brother s fury turns away 
until your brother s anger turn away from you and he forgets what you have done to him then i will send and get you from there why should i be bereaved of you both in one day ? 
rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob takes a wife of the daughters of heth such as these of the daughters of the land what good will my life do me ? 
isaac called jacob blessed him and commanded him you shall not take a wife of the daughters of canaan 
arise go to paddan aram to the house of bethuel your mother s father take a wife from there from the daughters of laban your mother s brother 
may god almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you that you may be a company of peoples 
and give you the blessing of abraham to you and to your seed with you that you may inherit the land where you travel which god gave to abraham 
isaac sent jacob away he went to paddan aram to laban son of bethuel the syrian rebekah s brother jacob s and esau s mother 
now esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to paddan aram to take him a wife from there and that as he blessed him he gave him a command saying you shall not take a wife of the daughters of canaan 
and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to paddan aram 
esau saw that the daughters of canaan didn t please isaac his father 
esau went to ishmael and took besides the wives that he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abraham s son the sister of nebaioth to be his wife 
jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran 
he came to a certain place and stayed there all night because the sun had set he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep 
he dreamed behold a stairway set upon the earth and its top reached to heaven behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it 
behold yahweh stood above it and said i am yahweh the god of abraham your father and the god of isaac the land whereon you lie to you will i give it and to your seed 
your seed will be as the dust of the earth and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed 
behold i am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you again into this land for i will not leave you until i have done that which i have spoken of to you 
jacob awakened out of his sleep and he said surely yahweh is in this place and i didn t know it 
he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place ! this is none other than god s house and this is the gate of heaven 
jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on its top 
he called the name of that place bethel but the name of the city was luz at the first 
jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and clothing to put on 
so that i come again to my father s house in peace and yahweh will be my god 
then this stone which i have set up for a pillar will be god s house of all that you will give me i will surely give the tenth to you 
then jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the children of the east 
he looked and behold a well in the field and behold three flocks of sheep lying there by it for out of that well they watered the flocks the stone on the well s mouth was large 
there all the flocks were gathered they rolled the stone from the well s mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again on the well s mouth in its place 
jacob said to them my relatives where are you from ? they said we are from haran 
he said to them do you know laban the son of nahor ? they said we know him 
he said to them is it well with him ? they said it is well see rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep 
he said behold it is still the middle of the day not time to gather the livestock together water the sheep and go and feed them 
they said we can t until all the flocks are gathered together and they roll the stone from the well s mouth then we water the sheep 
while he was yet speaking with them rachel came with her father s sheep for she kept them 
it happened when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mother s brother and the sheep of laban his mother s brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well s mouth and watered the flock of laban his mother s brother 
jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept 
jacob told rachel that he was her father s brother and that he was rebekah s son she ran and told her father 
it happened when laban heard the news of jacob his sister s son that he ran to meet jacob and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house jacob told laban all these things 
laban said to him surely you are my bone and my flesh he lived with him for a month 
laban said to jacob because you are my brother should you therefore serve me for nothing ? tell me what will your wages be ? 
laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel 
leah s eyes were weak but rachel was beautiful in form and attractive 
jacob loved rachel he said i will serve you seven years for rachel your younger daughter 
laban said it is better that i give her to you than that i should give her to another man stay with me 
jacob served seven years for rachel they seemed to him but a few days for the love he had for her 
jacob said to laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in to her 
laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast 
it happened in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him he went in to her 
laban gave zilpah his handmaid to his daughter leah for a handmaid 
it happened in the morning that behold it was leah he said to laban what is this you have done to me ? didn t i serve with you for rachel ? why then have you deceived me ? 
laban said it is not done so in our place to give the younger before the firstborn 
fulfill the week of this one and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years 
jacob did so and fulfilled her week he gave him rachel his daughter as wife 
laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid 
he went in also to rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years 
yahweh saw that leah was hated and he opened her womb but rachel was barren 
leah conceived and bore a son and she named him reuben for she said because yahweh has looked at my affliction for now my husband will love me 
she conceived again and bore a son and said because yahweh has heard that i am hated he has therefore given me this son also she named him simeon 
she conceived again and bore a son said now this time will my husband be joined to me because i have borne him three sons therefore his name was called levi 
she conceived again and bore a son she said this time will i praise yahweh therefore she named him judah then she stopped bearing 
when rachel saw that she bore jacob no children rachel envied her sister she said to jacob give me children or else i will die 
jacob s anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in god s place who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb ? 
she said behold my maid bilhah go in to her that she may bear on my knees and i also may obtain children by her 
she gave him bilhah her handmaid as wife and jacob went in to her 
bilhah conceived and bore jacob a son 
rachel said god has judged me and has also heard my voice and has given me a son therefore called she his name dan 
bilhah rachel s handmaid conceived again and bore jacob a second son 
rachel said with mighty wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and have prevailed she named him naphtali 
when leah saw that she had finished bearing she took zilpah her handmaid and gave her to jacob as a wife 
zilpah leah s handmaid bore jacob a son 
leah said how fortunate ! she named him gad 
zilpah leah s handmaid bore jacob a second son 
leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me happy she named him asher 
reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother leah then rachel said to leah please give me some of your son s mandrakes 
she said to her is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband ? would you take away my son s mandrakes also ? rachel said therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son s mandrakes 
jacob came from the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said you must come in to me for i have surely hired you with my son s mandrakes he lay with her that night 
god listened to leah and she conceived and bore jacob a fifth son 
leah said god has given me my hire because i gave my handmaid to my husband she named him issachar 
leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to jacob 
leah said god has endowed me with a good dowry now my husband will live with me because i have borne him six sons she named him zebulun 
afterwards she bore a daughter and named her dinah 
god remembered rachel and god listened to her and opened her womb 
it happened when rachel had borne joseph that jacob said to laban send me away that i may go to my own place and to my country 
give me my wives and my children for whom i have served you and let me go for you know my service with which i have served you 
laban said to him if now i have found favor in your eyes stay here for i have divined that yahweh has blessed me for your sake 
he said appoint me your wages and i will give it 
he said to him you know how i have served you and how your livestock have fared with me 
for it was little which you had before i came and it has increased to a multitude yahweh has blessed you wherever i turned now when will i provide for my own house also ? 
he said what shall i give you ? jacob said you shall not give me anything if you will do this thing for me i will again feed your flock and keep it 
i will pass through all your flock today removing from there every speckled and spotted one and every black one among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats this will be my hire 
so my righteousness will answer for me hereafter when you come concerning my hire that is before you every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the sheep that might be with me will be counted stolen 
laban said behold let it be according to your word 
that day he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted every one that had white in it and all the black ones among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons 
he set three days journey between himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of laban s flocks 
jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar almond plane tree peeled white streaks in them and made the white appear which was in the rods 
he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink they conceived when they came to drink 
the flocks conceived before the rods and the flocks produced streaked speckled and spotted 
jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of laban and he put his own droves apart and didn t put them into laban s flock 
it happened whenever the stronger of the flock conceived that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods 
but when the flock were feeble he didn t put them in so the feebler were laban s and the stronger jacob s 
the man increased exceedingly and had large flocks female servants and male servants and camels and donkeys 
he heard the words of laban s sons saying jacob has taken away all that was our father s from that which was our father s has he gotten all this wealth 
jacob saw the expression on laban s face and behold it was not toward him as before 
yahweh said to jacob return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives and i will be with you 
jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field to his flock 
and said to them i see the expression on your father s face that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father has been with me 
you know that i have served your father with all of my strength 
your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god didn t allow him to hurt me 
if he said this the speckled will be your wages then all the flock bore speckled if he said this the streaked will be your wages then all the flock bore streaked 
thus god has taken away your father s livestock and given them to me 
it happened during mating season that i lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream and behold the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked speckled and grizzled 
the angel of god said to me in the dream jacob and i said here i am 
he said now lift up your eyes and behold all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked speckled and grizzled for i have seen all that laban does to you 
i am the god of bethel where you anointed a pillar where you vowed a vow to me now arise get out from this land and return to the land of your birth 
for all the riches which god has taken away from our father that is ours and our children s now then whatever god has said to you do 
then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives on the camels 
and he took away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gathered including the livestock which he had gained in paddan aram to go to isaac his father to the land of canaan 
now laban had gone to shear his sheep and rachel stole the teraphim that were her father s 
jacob deceived laban the syrian in that he didn t tell him that he was running away 
so he fled with all that he had he rose up passed over the river and set his face toward the mountain of gilead 
laban was told on the third day that jacob had fled 
he took his relatives with him and pursued after him seven days journey he overtook him in the mountain of gilead 
god came to laban the syrian in a dream of the night and said to him take heed to yourself that you don t speak to jacob either good or bad 
laban caught up with jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of gilead 
laban said to jacob what have you done that you have deceived me and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword ?
why did you flee secretly and deceive me and didn t tell me that i might have sent you away with mirth and with songs with tambourine and with harp 
and didn t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? now have you done foolishly 
it is in the power of my hand to hurt you but the god of your father spoke to me last night saying take heed to yourself that you don t speak to jacob either good or bad 
now you want to be gone because you greatly longed for your father s house but why have you stolen my gods ? 
jacob answered laban because i was afraid for i said lest you should take your daughters from me by force 
anyone you find your gods with shall not live before our relatives discern what is yours with me and take it for jacob didn t know that rachel had stolen them 
laban went into jacob s tent into leah s tent and into the tent of the two female servants but he didn t find them he went out of leah s tent and entered into rachel s tent 
now rachel had taken the teraphim put them in the camel s saddle and sat on them laban felt about all the tent but didn t find them 
she said to her father don t let my lord be angry that i can t rise up before you for i m having my period he searched but didn t find the teraphim 
jacob was angry and argued with laban jacob answered laban what is my trespass ? what is my sin that you have hotly pursued after me ?
now that you have felt around in all my stuff what have you found of all your household stuff ? set it here before my relatives and your relatives that they may judge between us two 
 these twenty years i have been with you your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young and i haven t eaten the rams of your flocks 
that which was torn of animals i didn t bring to you i bore its loss of my hand you required it whether stolen by day or stolen by night 
this was my situation in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep fled from my eyes 
these twenty years i have been in your house i served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock and you have changed my wages ten times 
unless the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely now you would have sent me away empty god has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night 
laban answered jacob the daughters are my daughters the children are my children the flocks are my flocks and all that you see is mine and what can i do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne ?
now come let us make a covenant you and i and let it be for a witness between me and you 
jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar 
jacob said to his relatives gather stones they took stones and made a heap they ate there by the heap 
laban called it jegar sahadutha but jacob called it galeed 
laban said this heap is witness between me and you this day therefore it was named galeed
and mizpah for he said yahweh watch between me and you when we are absent one from another 
if you afflict my daughters or if you take wives besides my daughters no man is with us behold god is witness between me and you 
laban said to jacob see this heap and see the pillar which i have set between me and you 
may this heap be a witness and the pillar be a witness that i will not pass over this heap to you and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me for harm 
the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge between us then jacob swore by the fear of his father isaac 
jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain and called his relatives to eat bread they ate bread and stayed all night in the mountain 
early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them laban departed and returned to his place 
jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him 
when he saw them jacob said this is god s army he called the name of that place mahanaim 
jacob sent messengers in front of him to esau his brother to the land of seir the field of edom 
he commanded them saying this is what you shall tell my lord esau this is what your servant jacob says i have lived as a foreigner with laban and stayed until now 
i have cattle donkeys flocks male servants and female servants i have sent to tell my lord that i may find favor in your sight 
the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to your brother esau not only that but he comes to meet you and four hundred men with him 
then jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two companies 
and he said if esau comes to the one company and strikes it then the company which is left will escape 
jacob said god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac yahweh who said to me return to your country and to your relatives and i will do you good 
i am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses and of all the truth which you have shown to your servant for with just my staff i passed over this jordan and now i have become two companies 
please deliver me from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children 
you said i will surely do you good and make your seed as the sand of the sea which can t be numbered because there are so many 
he lodged there that night and took from that which he had with him a present for esau his brother 
he delivered them into the hands of his servants every herd by itself and said to his servants pass over before me and put a space between herd and herd 
he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meets you and asks you saying whose are you ? where are you going ? whose are these before you ? 
then you shall say they are your servant jacob s it is a present sent to my lord esau behold he also is behind us 
he commanded also the second and the third and all that followed the herds saying this is how you shall speak to esau when you find him 
you shall say not only that but behold your servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goes before me and afterward i will see his face perhaps he will accept me 
so the present passed over before him and he himself lodged that night in the camp 
he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two handmaids and his eleven sons and passed over the ford of the jabbok 
he took them and sent them over the stream and sent over that which he had 
jacob was left alone and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day 
when he saw that he didn t prevail against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob s thigh was strained as he wrestled 
the man said let me go for the day breaks jacob said i won t let you go unless you bless me 
he said to him what is your name ? he said jacob 
he said your name will no longer be called jacob but israel for you have fought with god and with men and have prevailed 
jacob asked him please tell me your name he said why is it that you ask what my name is ? he blessed him there 
jacob called the name of the place peniel for he said i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved 
the sun rose on him as he passed over peniel and he limped because of his thigh 
therefore the children of israel don t eat the sinew of the hip which is on the hollow of the thigh to this day because he touched the hollow of jacob s thigh in the sinew of the hip 
jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau was coming and with him four hundred men he divided the children between leah rachel and the two handmaids 
he put the handmaids and their children in front leah and her children after and rachel and joseph at the rear 
he himself passed over in front of them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother 
esau ran to meet him embraced him fell on his neck kissed him and they wept 
he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are these with you ? he said the children whom god has graciously given your servant 
then the handmaids came near with their children and they bowed themselves 
leah also and her children came near and bowed themselves after them joseph came near with rachel and they bowed themselves 
esau said what do you mean by all this company which i met ? jacob said to find favor in the sight of my lord 
esau said i have enough my brother let that which you have be yours 
jacob said please no if i have now found favor in your sight then receive my present at my hand because i have seen your face as one sees the face of god and you were pleased with me 
please take the gift that i brought to you because god has dealt graciously with me and because i have enough he urged him and he took it 
esau said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before you 
jacob said to him my lord knows that the children are tender and that the flocks and herds with me have their young and if they overdrive them one day all the flocks will die 
please let my lord pass over before his servant and i will lead on gently according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children until i come to my lord to seir 
esau said let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me he said why ? let me find favor in the sight of my lord 
so esau returned that day on his way to seir 
jacob traveled to succoth built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock therefore the name of the place is called succoth 
jacob came in peace to the city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from paddan aram and encamped before the city 
he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechem s father for one hundred pieces of money 
he erected an altar there and called it el elohe israel 
dinah the daughter of leah whom she bore to jacob went out to see the daughters of the land 
shechem the son of hamor the hivite the prince of the land saw her he took her lay with her and humbled her 
his soul joined to dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the young lady and spoke kindly to the young lady 
shechem spoke to his father hamor saying get me this young lady as a wife 
now jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter and his sons were with his livestock in the field jacob held his peace until they came 
hamor the father of shechem went out to jacob to talk with him 
the sons of jacob came in from the field when they heard it the men were grieved and they were very angry because he had done folly in israel in lying with jacob s daughter a which thing ought not to be done 
hamor talked with them saying the soul of my son shechem longs for your daughter please give her to him as a wife 
make marriages with us give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves 
you shall dwell with us and the land will be before you live and trade in it and get possessions in it 
shechem said to her father and to her brothers let me find favor in your eyes and whatever you will tell me i will give 
ask me a great amount for a dowry and i will give whatever you ask of me but give me the young lady as a wife 
the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father with deceit and spoke because he had defiled dinah their sister 
and said to them we can t do this thing to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised for that is a reproach to us 
only on this condition will we consent to you if you will be as we are that every male of you be circumcised 
then will we give our daughters to you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people 
but if you will not listen to us to be circumcised then we will take our sister and we will be gone 
their words pleased hamor and shechem hamor s son 
the young man didn t wait to do this thing because he had delight in jacob s daughter and he was honored above all the house of his father 
hamor and shechem his son came to the gate of their city and talked with the men of their city saying 
 these men are peaceful with us therefore let them live in the land and trade in it for behold the land is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters 
only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us to become one people if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised 
won t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours ? only let us give our consent to them and they will dwell with us 
all who went out of the gate of his city listened to hamor and to shechem his son and every male was circumcised all who went out of the gate of his city 
it happened on the third day when they were sore that two of jacob s sons simeon and levi dinah s brothers each took his sword came upon the unsuspecting city and killed all the males 
they killed hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechem s house and went away 
jacob s sons came on the dead and plundered the city because they had defiled their sister 
they took their flocks their herds their donkeys that which was in the city that which was in the field 
and all their wealth they took captive all their little ones and their wives and took as plunder everything that was in the house 
jacob said to simeon and levi you have troubled me to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites i am few in number they will gather themselves together against me and strike me and i will be destroyed i and my house 
they said should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute ? 
god said to jacob arise go up to bethel and live there make there an altar to god who appeared to you when you fled from the face of esau your brother 
then jacob said to his household and to all who were with him put away the foreign gods that are among you purify yourselves change your garments 
let us arise and go up to bethel i will make there an altar to god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went 
they gave to jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands and the rings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem 
they traveled and a terror of god was on the cities that were around them and they didn t pursue the sons of jacob 
so jacob came to luz that is bethel which is in the land of canaan he and all the people who were with him 
he built an altar there and called the place el beth el because there god was revealed to him when he fled from the face of his brother 
deborah rebekah s nurse died and she was buried below bethel under the oak and its name was called allon bacuth 
god appeared to jacob again when he came from paddan aram and blessed him 
god said to him your name is jacob your name shall not be jacob any more but your name will be israel he named him israel 
god said to him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations will be from you and kings will come out of your body 
the land which i gave to abraham and isaac i will give it to you and to your seed after you will i give the land 
god went up from him in the place where he spoke with him 
they traveled from bethel there was still some distance to come to ephrath and rachel travailed she had hard labor 
when she was in hard labor the midwife said to her don t be afraid for now you will have another son 
it happened as her soul was departing for she died that she named him benoni but his father named him benjamin 
rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath the same is bethlehem 
jacob set up a pillar on her grave the same is the pillar of rachel s grave to this day 
israel traveled and spread his tent beyond the tower of eder 
it happened while israel lived in that land that reuben went and lay with bilhah his father s concubine and israel heard of it now the sons of jacob were twelve

jacob lived in the land of his father s travels in the land of canaan 
this is the history of the generations of jacob joseph being seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brothers he was a boy with the sons of bilhah and zilpah his father s wives joseph brought an evil report of them to their father 
now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors 
his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers and they hated him and couldn t speak peaceably to him 
joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brothers and they hated him all the more 
he said to them please hear this dream which i have dreamed 
for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and behold my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves came around and bowed down to my sheaf 
his brothers said to him will you indeed reign over us ? or will you indeed have dominion over us ? they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words 
he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers and said behold i have dreamed yet another dream and behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me 
he told it to his father and to his brothers his father rebuked him and said to him what is this dream that you have dreamed ? will i and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth ? 
his brothers envied him but his father kept this saying in mind 
his brothers went to feed their father s flock in shechem 
israel said to joseph aren t your brothers feeding the flock in shechem ? come and i will send you to them he said to him here i am 
he said to him go now see whether it is well with your brothers and well with the flock and bring me word again so he sent him out of the valley of hebron and he came to shechem 
a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field the man asked him what are you looking for ? 
he said i am looking for my brothers tell me please where they are feeding the flock 
the man said they have left here for i heard them say let us go to dothan joseph went after his brothers and found them in dothan 
they saw him afar off and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him 
they said one to another behold this dreamer comes 
come now therefore and let s kill him and cast him into one of the pits and we will say an evil animal has devoured him we will see what will become of his dreams 
reuben heard it and delivered him out of their hand and said let s not take his life 
reuben said to them shed no blood throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness but lay no hand on him that he might deliver him out of their hand to restore him to his father 
it happened when joseph came to his brothers that they stripped joseph of his coat the coat of many colors that was on him 
and they took him and threw him into the pit the pit was empty there was no water in it 
they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and saw a caravan of ishmaelites was coming from gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt 
judah said to his brothers what profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood ?
come and let s sell him to the ishmaelites and not let our hand be on him for he is our brother our flesh his brothers listened to him 
midianites who were merchants passed by and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver they brought joseph into egypt 
reuben returned to the pit and saw that joseph wasn t in the pit and he tore his clothes 
he returned to his brothers and said the child is no more and i where will i go ? 
they took joseph s coat and killed a male goat and dipped the coat in the blood 
they took the coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and said we have found this examine it now whether it is your son s coat or not 
he recognized it and said it is my son s coat an evil animal has devoured him joseph is without doubt torn in pieces 
jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his waist and mourned for his son many days 
all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted he said for i will go down to sheol to my son mourning his father wept for him 
the midianites sold him into egypt to potiphar an officer of pharaoh s the captain of the guard 
it happened at that time that judah went down from his brothers and visited a certain adullamite whose name was hirah 
judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua he took her and went in to her 
she conceived and bore a son and he named him er 
she conceived again and bore a son and she named him onan 
she yet again bore a son and named him shelah and he was at chezib when she bore him 
judah took a wife for er his firstborn and her name was tamar 
er judah s firstborn was wicked in the sight of yahweh yahweh killed him 
judah said to onan go in to your brother s wife and perform the duty of a husband s brother to her and raise up seed to your brother 
onan knew that the seed wouldn t be his and it happened when he went in to his brother s wife that he spilled it on the ground lest he should give seed to his brother 
the thing which he did was evil in the sight of yahweh and he killed him also 
then judah said to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow in your father s house until shelah my son is grown up for he said lest he also die like his brothers tamar went and lived in her father s house 
after many days shua s daughter the wife of judah died judah was comforted and went up to his sheepshearers to timnah he and his friend hirah the adullamite 
it was told tamar saying behold your father in law is going up to timnah to shear his sheep 
she took off of her the garments of her widowhood and covered herself with her veil and wrapped herself and sat in the gate of enaim which is by the way to timnah for she saw that shelah was grown up and she wasn t given to him as a wife 
when judah saw her he thought that she was a prostitute for she had covered her face 
he turned to her by the way and said please come let me come in to you for he didn t know that she was his daughter in law she said what will you give me that you may come in to me ? 
he said i will send you a young goat from the flock she said will you give me a pledge until you send it ? 
he said what pledge will i give you ? she said your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand he gave them to her and came in to her and she conceived by him 
she arose and went away and put off her veil from her and put on the garments of her widowhood 
judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive the pledge from the woman s hand but he didn t find her 
then he asked the men of her place saying where is the prostitute that was at enaim by the road ? they said there has been no prostitute here 
he returned to judah and said i haven t found her and also the men of the place said there has been no prostitute here 
judah said let her keep it lest we be shamed behold i sent this young goat and you haven t found her 
it happened about three months later that it was told judah saying tamar your daughter in law has played the prostitute and moreover behold she is with child by prostitution judah said bring her out and let her be burnt 
when she was brought out she sent to her father in law saying by the man whose these are i am with child she also said please discern whose are these the signet and the cords and the staff 
judah acknowledged them and said she is more righteous than i because i didn t give her to shelah my son he knew her again no more 
it happened in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb 
when she travailed one put out a hand and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand saying this came out first 
it happened as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said why have you made a breach for yourself ? therefore his name was called perez 
afterward his brother came out that had the scarlet thread on his hand and his name was called zerah 
joseph was brought down to egypt potiphar an officer of pharaoh s the captain of the guard an egyptian bought him from the hand of the ishmaelites that had brought him down there 
yahweh was with joseph and he was a prosperous man he was in the house of his master the egyptian 
his master saw that yahweh was with him and that yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand 
joseph found favor in his sight he ministered to him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand 
it happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that yahweh blessed the egyptian s house for joseph s sake and the blessing of yahweh was on all that he had in the house and in the field 
he left all that he had in joseph s hand he didn t concern himself with anything except for the food which he ate joseph was well built and handsome 
it happened after these things that his master s wife cast her eyes on joseph and she said lie with me 
but he refused and said to his master s wife behold my master doesn t know what is with me in the house and he has put all that he has into my hand 
he isn t greater in this house than i neither has he kept back anything from me but you because you are his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god ? 
as she spoke to joseph day by day he didn t listen to her to lie by her or to be with her 
about this time he went into the house to do his work and there were none of the men of the house inside 
she caught him by his garment saying lie with me ! he left his garment in her hand and ran outside 
when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had run outside 
she called to the men of her house and spoke to them saying behold he has brought in a hebrew to us to mock us he came in to me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice 
it happened when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment by me and ran outside 
she laid up his garment by her until his master came home 
she spoke to him according to these words saying the hebrew servant whom you have brought to us came in to me to mock me 
and it happened as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment by me and ran outside 
it happened when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him saying this is what your servant did to me that his wrath was kindled 
joseph s master took him and put him into the prison the place where the king s prisoners were bound and he was there in custody 
but yahweh was with joseph and showed kindness to him and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison 
the keeper of the prison committed to joseph s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison whatever they did there he was responsible for it 
the keeper of the prison didn t look after anything that was under his hand because yahweh was with him and that which he did yahweh made it prosper 
it happened after these things that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of egypt 
pharaoh was angry with his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief baker 
he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound 
the captain of the guard assigned them to joseph and he took care of them they stayed in prison many days 
they both dreamed a dream each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the cupbearer and the baker of the king of egypt who were bound in the prison 
joseph came in to them in the morning and saw them and saw that they were sad 
he asked pharaoh s officers who were with him in custody in his master s house saying why do you look so sad today ? 
they said to him we have dreamed a dream and there is no one who can interpret it joseph said to them don t interpretations belong to god ? please tell it to me 
the chief cupbearer told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was in front of me 
and in the vine were three branches it was as though it budded it blossomed and its clusters produced ripe grapes 
pharaoh s cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaoh s cup and i gave the cup into pharaoh s hand 
joseph said to him this is its interpretation the three branches are three days 
within three more days pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office you will give pharaoh s cup into his hand the way you did when you were his cupbearer 
but remember me when it will be well with you and please show kindness to me and make mention of me to pharaoh and bring me out of this house 
for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon 
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said to joseph i also was in my dream and behold three baskets of white bread were on my head 
in the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for pharaoh and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head 
joseph answered this is its interpretation the three baskets are three days 
within three more days pharaoh will lift up your head from off you and will hang you on a tree and the birds will eat your flesh from off you 
it happened the third day which was pharaoh s birthday that he made a feast for all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants 
he restored the chief cupbearer to his position again and he gave the cup into pharaoh s hand 
but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them 
yet the chief cupbearer didn t remember joseph but forgot him 
it happened at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river 
behold there came up out of the river seven cattle sleek and fat and they fed in the marsh grass 
behold seven other cattle came up after them out of the river ugly and thin and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river 
the ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle so pharaoh awoke 
he slept and dreamed a second time and behold seven heads of grain came up on one stalk healthy and good 
behold seven heads of grain thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them 
the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream 
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all of egypt s magicians and wise men pharaoh told them his dreams but there was no one who could interpret them to pharaoh 
then the chief cupbearer spoke to pharaoh saying i remember my faults today 
pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard me and the chief baker 
we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream 
there was with us there a young man a hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he interpreted 
it happened as he interpreted to us so it was he restored me to my office and he hanged him 
then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon he shaved himself changed his clothing and came in to pharaoh 
pharaoh said to joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is no one who can interpret it i have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it 
joseph answered pharaoh saying it isn t in me god will give pharaoh an answer of peace 
pharaoh spoke to joseph in my dream behold i stood on the brink of the river 
and behold there came up out of the river seven cattle fat and sleek they fed in the marsh grass 
and behold seven other cattle came up after them poor and very ugly and thin such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for ugliness 
the thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle 
and when they had eaten them up it couldn t be known that they had eaten them but they were still ugly as at the beginning so i awoke 
i saw in my dream and behold seven heads of grain came up on one stalk full and good 
and behold seven heads of grain withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them 
the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain i told it to the magicians but there was no one who could explain it to me 
joseph said to pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one what god is about to do he has declared to pharaoh 
the seven good cattle are seven years and the seven good heads of grain are seven years the dream is one 
the seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind they will be seven years of famine 
that is the thing which i spoke to pharaoh what god is about to do he has shown to pharaoh 
behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt 
there will arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of egypt the famine will consume the land 
and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows for it will be very grievous 
the dream was doubled to pharaoh because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass 
 now therefore let pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man and set him over the land of egypt 
let pharaoh do this and let him appoint overseers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt s produce in the seven plenteous years 
let them gather all the food of these good years that come and lay up grain under the hand of pharaoh for food in the cities and let them keep it 
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine which will be in the land of egypt that the land not perish through the famine 
the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants 
pharaoh said to his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom is the spirit of god ? 
pharaoh said to joseph because god has shown you all of this there is none so discreet and wise as you 
you shall be over my house and according to your word will all my people be ruled only in the throne i will be greater than you 
pharaoh said to joseph behold i have set you over all the land of egypt 
pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on joseph s hand and arrayed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck 
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had they cried before him bow the knee ! he set him over all the land of egypt 
pharaoh said to joseph i am pharaoh and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of egypt 
pharaoh called joseph s name zaphenath paneah and he gave him asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on as a wife joseph went out over the land of egypt 
joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt 
in the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly 
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was around every city he laid up in the same 
joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea very much until he stopped counting for it was without number 
to joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came whom asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on bore to him 
joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for he said god has made me forget all my toil and all my father s house 
the name of the second he called ephraim for god has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction 
the seven years of plenty that were in the land of egypt came to an end 
the seven years of famine began to come just as joseph had said there was famine in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread 
when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said to all the egyptians go to joseph what he says to you do 
the famine was over all the surface of the earth joseph opened all the store houses and sold to the egyptians the famine was severe in the land of egypt 
all countries came into egypt to joseph to buy grain because the famine was severe in all the earth 
now jacob saw that there was grain in egypt and jacob said to his sons why do you look at one another ? 
he said behold i have heard that there is grain in egypt go down there and buy for us from there so that we may live and not die 
joseph s ten brothers went down to buy grain from egypt 
but jacob didn t send benjamin joseph s brother with his brothers for he said lest perhaps harm happen to him 
the sons of israel came to buy among those who came for the famine was in the land of canaan 
joseph was the governor over the land it was he who sold to all the people of the land joseph s brothers came and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth 
joseph saw his brothers and he recognized them but acted like a stranger to them and spoke roughly with them he said to them where did you come from ? they said from the land of canaan to buy food 
joseph recognized his brothers but they didn t recognize him 
joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them and said to them you are spies ! you have come to see the nakedness of the land 
they said to him no my lord but your servants have come to buy food 
we are all one man s sons we are honest men your servants are not spies 
he said to them no but you have come to see the nakedness of the land ! 
they said we your servants are twelve brothers the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is no more 
joseph said to them it is like i told you saying you are spies ! 
by this you shall be tested by the life of pharaoh you shall not go out from here unless your youngest brother comes here 
send one of you and let him get your brother and you shall be bound that your words may be tested whether there is truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely you are spies 
he put them all together into custody for three days 
joseph said to them the third day do this and live for i fear god 
if you are honest men then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison but you go carry grain for the famine of your houses 
bring your youngest brother to me so will your words be verified and you won t die they did so 
they said one to another we are certainly guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the distress of his soul when he begged us and we wouldn t listen therefore this distress has come upon us 
reuben answered them saying didn t i tell you saying don t sin against the child and you wouldn t listen ? therefore also behold his blood is required 
they didn t know that joseph understood them for there was an interpreter between them 
he turned himself away from them and wept then he returned to them and spoke to them and took simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes 
then joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain and to restore each man s money into his sack and to give them food for the way so it was done to them 
they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there 
as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place he saw his money behold it was in the mouth of his sack 
he said to his brothers my money is restored ! behold it is in my sack ! their hearts failed them and they turned trembling one to another saying what is this that god has done to us ? 
they came to jacob their father to the land of canaan and told him all that had happened to them saying 
 the man the lord of the land spoke roughly with us and took us for spies of the country 
we said to him we are honest men we are no spies 
we are twelve brothers sons of our father one is no more and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan 
the man the lord of the land said to us by this i will know that you are honest men leave one of your brothers with me and take grain for the famine of your houses and go your way 
bring your youngest brother to me then i will know that you are not spies but that you are honest men so i will deliver your brother to you and you shall trade in the land 
it happened as they emptied their sacks that behold each man s bundle of money was in his sack when they and their father saw their bundles of money they were afraid 
jacob their father said to them you have bereaved me of my children ! joseph is no more simeon is no more and you want to take benjamin away all these things are against me 
reuben spoke to his father saying kill my two sons if i don t bring him to you entrust him to my care and i will bring him to you again 
he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he only is left if harm happens to him along the way in which you go then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol 
the famine was severe in the land 
it happened when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of egypt their father said to them go again buy us a little more food 
judah spoke to him saying the man solemnly warned us saying you shall not see my face unless your brother is with you 
if you ll send our brother with us we ll go down and buy you food 
but if you ll not send him we ll not go down for the man said to us you shall not see my face unless your brother is with you 
israel said why did you treat me so badly telling the man that you had another brother ? 
they said the man asked directly concerning ourselves and concerning our relatives saying is your father still alive ? have you another brother ? we just answered his questions is there any way we could know that he would say bring your brother down ? 
judah said to israel his father send the boy with me and we ll get up and go so that we may live and not die both we and you and also our little ones 
i ll be collateral for him from my hand will you require him if i don t bring him to you and set him before you then let me bear the blame forever 
for if we hadn t delayed surely we would have returned a second time by now 
their father israel said to them if it must be so then do this take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags and carry down a present for the man a little balm a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds 
and take double money in your hand and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks perhaps it was an oversight 
take your brother also get up and return to the man 
may god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may release to you your other brother and benjamin if i am bereaved of my children i am bereaved 
the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and got up went down to egypt and stood before joseph 
when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the steward of his house bring the men into the house and butcher an animal and prepare for the men will dine with me at noon 
the man did as joseph commanded and the man brought the men to joseph s house 
the men were afraid because they were brought to joseph s house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time we re brought in that he may seek occasion against us attack us and seize us as slaves along with our donkeys 
they came near to the steward of joseph s house and they spoke to him at the door of the house 
and said oh my lord we indeed came down the first time to buy food 
when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks and behold each man s money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight we have brought it back in our hand 
we have brought down other money in our hand to buy food we don t know who put our money in our sacks 
he said peace be to you don t be afraid your god and the god of your father has given you treasure in your sacks i received your money he brought simeon out to them 
the man brought the men into joseph s house and gave them water and they washed their feet he gave their donkeys fodder 
they prepared the present for joseph s coming at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there 
when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves down to him to the earth 
he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom you spoke ? is he yet alive ? 
they said your servant our father is well he is still alive they bowed down humbly 
he lifted up his eyes and saw benjamin his brother his mother s son and said is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me ? he said god be gracious to you my son 
joseph hurried for his heart yearned over his brother and he sought a place to weep he entered into his room and wept there 
he washed his face and came out he controlled himself and said serve the meal 
they served him by himself and them by themselves and the egyptians that ate with him by themselves because the egyptians don t eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination to the egyptians 
they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marveled one with another 
he sent portions to them from before him but benjamin s portion was five times as much as any of theirs they drank and were merry with him 
he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men s sacks with food as much as they can carry and put each man s money in his sack s mouth 
put my cup the silver cup in the sack s mouth of the youngest with his grain money he did according to the word that joseph had spoken 
as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their donkeys 
when they had gone out of the city and were not yet far off joseph said to his steward up follow after the men when you overtake them ask them why have you rewarded evil for good ?
isn t this that from which my lord drinks and by which he indeed divines ? you have done evil in so doing 
he overtook them and he spoke these words to them 
they said to him why does my lord speak such words as these ? far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing !
behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again to you out of the land of canaan how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord s house ?
with whomever of your servants it is found let him die and we also will be my lord s bondservants 
he said now also let it be according to your words he with whom it is found will be my bondservant and you will be blameless 
then they hurried and each man took his sack down to the ground and each man opened his sack 
he searched beginning with the eldest and ending at the youngest the cup was found in benjamin s sack 
then they tore their clothes and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city 
judah and his brothers came to joseph s house and he was still there they fell on the ground before him 
joseph said to them what deed is this that you have done ? don t you know that such a man as i can indeed divine ? 
judah said what will we tell my lord ? what will we speak ? or how will we clear ourselves ? god has found out the iniquity of your servants behold we are my lord s bondservants both we and he also in whose hand the cup is found 
he said far be it from me that i should do so the man in whose hand the cup is found he will be my bondservant but as for you go up in peace to your father 
then judah came near to him and said oh my lord please let your servant speak a word in my lord s ears and don t let your anger burn against your servant for you are even as pharaoh 
my lord asked his servants saying have you a father or a brother ? 
we said to my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loves him 
you said to your servants bring him down to me that i may set my eyes on him 
we said to my lord the boy can t leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die 
you said to your servants unless your youngest brother comes down with you you will see my face no more 
it happened when we came up to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord 
our father said go again buy us a little food 
we said we can t go down if our youngest brother is with us then we will go down for we may not see the man s face unless our youngest brother is with us 
your servant my father said to us you know that my wife bore me two sons 
and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i haven t seen him since 
if you take this one also from me and harm happens to him you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol 
now therefore when i come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us since his life is bound up in the boy s life 
it will happen when he sees that the boy is no more that he will die your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to sheol 
for your servant became collateral for the boy to my father saying if i don t bring him to you then i will bear the blame to my father forever 
now therefore please let your servant stay instead of the boy a bondservant to my lord and let the boy go up with his brothers 
for how will i go up to my father if the boy isn t with me ? lest i see the evil that will come on my father 
then joseph couldn t control himself before all those who stood before him and he cried cause everyone to go out from me ! no one else stood with him while joseph made himself known to his brothers 
he wept aloud the egyptians heard and the house of pharaoh heard 
joseph said to his brothers i am joseph ! does my father still live ? his brothers couldn t answer him for they were terrified at his presence 
joseph said to his brothers come near to me please they came near he said i am joseph your brother whom you sold into egypt 
now don t be grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me here for god sent me before you to preserve life 
for these two years the famine has been in the land and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest 
god sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth and to save you alive by a great deliverance 
so now it wasn t you who sent me here but god and he has made me a father to pharaoh lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of egypt 
hurry and go up to my father and tell him this is what your son joseph says god has made me lord of all egypt come down to me don t wait 
you shall dwell in the land of goshen and you will be near to me you your children your children s children your flocks your herds and all that you have 
there i will nourish you for there are yet five years of famine lest you come to poverty you and your household and all that you have 
behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaks to you 
you shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that you have seen you shall hurry and bring my father down here 
he fell on his brother benjamin s neck and wept and benjamin wept on his neck 
he kissed all his brothers and wept on them after that his brothers talked with him 
the report of it was heard in pharaoh s house saying joseph s brothers have come it pleased pharaoh well and his servants 
pharaoh said to joseph tell your brothers do this load your animals and go travel to the land of canaan 
take your father and your households and come to me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and you will eat the fat of the land 
now you are commanded do this take wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come 
also don t concern yourselves about your belongings for the good of all of the land of egypt is yours 
the sons of israel did so joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way 
he gave each one of them changes of clothing but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing 
he sent the following to his father ten donkeys loaded with the good things of egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way 
so he sent his brothers away and they departed he said to them see that you don t quarrel on the way 
they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan to jacob their father 
they told him saying joseph is still alive and he is ruler over all the land of egypt his heart fainted for he didn t believe them 
they told him all the words of joseph which he had said to them when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived 
israel traveled with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices to the god of his father isaac 
god spoke to israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob ! he said here i am 
he said i am god the god of your father don t be afraid to go down into egypt for there i will make of you a great nation 
i will go down with you into egypt i will also surely bring you up again joseph will close your eyes 
jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him 
they took their livestock and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him 
his sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sons daughters and he brought all his seed with him into egypt 
these are the names of the children of israel who came into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacob s firstborn 
the sons of reuben hanoch pallu hezron and carmi 
the sons of simeon jemuel jamin ohad jachin zohar and shaul the son of a canaanite woman 
the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari

all the souls who came with jacob into egypt who were his direct descendants besides jacob s sons wives all the souls were sixty six 
the sons of joseph who were born to him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob who came into egypt were seventy 
he sent judah before him to joseph to show the way before him to goshen and they came into the land of goshen 
joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet israel his father in goshen he presented himself to him and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while 
israel said to joseph now let me die since i have seen your face that you are still alive 
joseph said to his brothers and to his father s house i will go up and speak with pharaoh and will tell him my brothers and my father s house who were in the land of canaan have come to me 
these men are shepherds for they have been keepers of livestock and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have 
it will happen when pharaoh summons you and will say what is your occupation ? 
that you shall say your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now both we and our fathers that you may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the egyptians 
then joseph went in and told pharaoh and said my father and my brothers with their flocks their herds and all that they own have come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen 
from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to pharaoh 
pharaoh said to his brothers what is your occupation ? they said to pharaoh your servants are shepherds both we and our fathers 
they said to pharaoh we have come to live as foreigners in the land for there is no pasture for your servants flocks for the famine is severe in the land of canaan now therefore please let your servants dwell in the land of goshen 
pharaoh spoke to joseph saying your father and your brothers have come to you 
the land of egypt is before you make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land let them dwell in the land of goshen if you know any able men among them then put them in charge of my livestock 
joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh 
pharaoh said to jacob how many are the days of the years of your life ? 
jacob said to pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years few and evil have been the days of the years of my life and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage 
jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from the presence of pharaoh 
joseph placed his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded 
joseph nourished his father his brothers and all of his father s household with bread according to their families 
there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very severe so that the land of egypt and the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine 
joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the grain which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaoh s house 
when the money was all spent in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came to joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in your presence ? for our money fails 
joseph said give me your livestock and i will give you food for your livestock if your money is gone 
they brought their livestock to joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses and for the flocks and for the herds and for the donkeys and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year 
when that year was ended they came to him the second year and said to him we will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent and the herds of livestock are my lord s there is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands 
why should we die before your eyes both we and our land ? buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants to pharaoh give us seed that we may live and not die and that the land won t be desolate 
so joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for every man of the egyptians sold his field because the famine was severe on them and the land became pharaoh s 
as for the people he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end of it 
only he didn t buy the land of the priests for the priests had a portion from pharaoh and ate their portion which pharaoh gave them that is why they didn t sell their land 
then joseph said to the people behold i have bought you and your land today for pharaoh behold here is seed for you and you shall sow the land 
it will happen at the harvests that you shall give a fifth to pharaoh and four parts will be your own for seed of the field for your food for them of your households and for food for your little ones 
israel lived in the land of egypt in the land of goshen and they got themselves possessions therein and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly 
jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the days of jacob the years of his life were one hundred forty seven years 
the time drew near that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said to him if now i have found favor in your sight please put your hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me please don t bury me in egypt 
but when i sleep with my fathers you shall carry me out of egypt and bury me in their burying place he said i will do as you have said 
he said swear to me and he swore to him israel bowed himself on the bed s head 
it happened after these things that someone said to joseph behold your father is sick he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim 
someone told jacob and said behold your son joseph comes to you and israel strengthened himself and sat on the bed 
jacob said to joseph god almighty appeared to me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me 
and said to me behold i will make you fruitful and multiply you and i will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession 
now your two sons who were born to you in the land of egypt before i came to you into egypt are mine ephraim and manasseh even as reuben and simeon will be mine 
your issue whom you become the father of after them will be yours they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance 
as for me when i came from paddan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when there was still some distance to come to ephrath and i buried her there in the way to ephrath the same is bethlehem 
israel saw joseph s sons and said who are these ? 
joseph said to his father they are my sons whom god has given me here he said please bring them to me and i will bless them 
now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he couldn t see he brought them near to him and he kissed them and embraced them 
israel said to joseph i didn t think i would see your face and behold god has let me see your seed also 
joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth 
joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israel s left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israel s right hand and brought them near to him 
israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on ephraim s head who was the younger and his left hand on manasseh s head guiding his hands knowingly for manasseh was the firstborn 
he blessed joseph and said the god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac walked the god who has fed me all my life long to this day 
the angel who has redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth 
when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of ephraim it displeased him he held up his father s hand to remove it from ephraim s head to manasseh s head 
joseph said to his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put your right hand on his head 
his father refused and said i know my son i know he also will become a people and he also will be great however his younger brother will be greater than he and his seed will become a multitude of nations 
he blessed them that day saying in you will israel bless saying god make you as ephraim and as manasseh he set ephraim before manasseh 
israel said to joseph behold i am dying but god will be with you and bring you again to the land of your fathers 
jacob called to his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come 
assemble yourselves and hear you sons of jacob listen to israel your father 
 reuben you are my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength excelling in dignity and excelling in power 
boiling over as water you shall not excel because you went up to your father s bed then defiled it he went up to my couch 
 simeon and levi are brothers their swords are weapons of violence 
my soul don t come into their council my glory don t be united to their assembly for in their anger they killed men in their self will they hamstrung cattle 
cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel 
 judah your brothers will praise you your hand will be on the neck of your enemies your father s sons will bow down before you 
judah is a lion s cub from the prey my son you have gone up he stooped down he crouched as a lion as a lioness who will rouse him up ?
the scepter will not depart from judah nor the ruler s staff from between his feet until he comes to whom it belongs to him will the obedience of the peoples be 
binding his foal to the vine his donkey s colt to the choice vine he has washed his garments in wine his robes in the blood of grapes 
his eyes will be red with wine his teeth white with milk 
 zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea he will be for a haven of ships his border will be on sidon 
 issachar is a strong donkey lying down between the saddlebags 
he saw a resting place that it was good the land that it was pleasant he bows his shoulder to the burden and becomes a servant doing forced labor 
 dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of israel 
dan will be a serpent in the way an adder in the path that bites the horse s heels so that his rider falls backward 
i have waited for your salvation yahweh 
 a troop will press on gad but he will press on their heel 
 asher s food will be rich he will yield royal dainties 
 naphtali is a doe set free who bears beautiful fawns 
 joseph is a fruitful vine a fruitful vine by a spring his branches run over the wall 
the archers have severely grieved him shot at him and persecute him 
but his bow remained strong the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty one of jacob from there is the shepherd the stone of israel 
even by the god of your father who will help you by the almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lies below blessings of the breasts and of the womb 
the blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors above the boundaries of the ancient hills they will be on the head of joseph on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers 
 benjamin is a ravenous wolf in the morning he will devour the prey at evening he will divide the spoil 
all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them he blessed everyone according to his blessing 
he instructed them and said to them i am to be gathered to my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite 
in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field from ephron the hittite as a burial place 
there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah 
the field and the cave that is therein which was purchased from the children of heth 
joseph fell on his father s face wept on him and kissed him 
joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel 
forty days were fulfilled for him for that is how many the days it takes to embalm the egyptians wept for him for seventy days 
when the days of weeping for him were past joseph spoke to the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found favor in your eyes please speak in the ears of pharaoh saying 
 my father made me swear saying behold i am dying bury me in my grave which i have dug for myself in the land of canaan now therefore please let me go up and bury my father and i will come again 
pharaoh said go up and bury your father just like he made you swear 
joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house all the elders of the land of egypt 
all the house of joseph his brothers and his father s house only their little ones their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen 
there went up with him both chariots and horsemen it was a very great company 
they came to the threshing floor of atad which is beyond the jordan and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation he mourned for his father seven days 
when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning by the egyptians therefore its name was called abel mizraim which is beyond the jordan 
his sons did to him just as he commanded them 
for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial site from ephron the hittite before mamre 
joseph returned into egypt he and his brothers and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father 
when joseph s brothers saw that their father was dead they said it may be that joseph will hate us and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him 
they sent a message to joseph saying your father commanded before he died saying 
 you shall tell joseph now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers and their sin because they did evil to you now please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the god of your father joseph wept when they spoke to him 
his brothers also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we are your servants 
joseph said to them don t be afraid for am i in the place of god ?
as for you you meant evil against me but god meant it for good to bring to pass as it is this day to save many people alive 
now therefore don t be afraid i will nourish you and your little ones he comforted them and spoke kindly to them 
joseph lived in egypt he and his father s house joseph lived one hundred ten years 
joseph saw ephraim s children to the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were born on joseph s knees 
joseph said to his brothers i am dying but god will surely visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to abraham to isaac and to jacob 
joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and you shall carry up my bones from here 
so joseph died being one hundred ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt 
the proverbs of solomon the son of david king of israel 
to know wisdom and instruction to discern the words of understanding 
to receive instruction in wise dealing in righteousness justice and equity 
to give prudence to the simple knowledge and discretion to the young man 
that the wise man may hear and increase in learning that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel 
to understand a proverb and parables the words and riddles of the wise 
the fear of yahweh is the beginning of knowledge but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction 
my son listen to your father s instruction and don t forsake your mother s teaching 
for they will be a garland to grace your head and chains around your neck 
my son if sinners entice you don t consent 
if they say come with us let s lay in wait for blood let s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause 
let s swallow them up alive like sheol and whole like those who go down into the pit 
we ll find all valuable wealth we ll fill our houses with spoil 
you shall cast your lot among us we ll all have one purse 
my son don t walk in the way with them keep your foot from their path 
for their feet run to evil they hurry to shed blood 
for in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird 
but these lay wait for their own blood they lurk secretly for their own lives 
so are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain it takes away the life of its owners 
wisdom calls aloud in the street she utters her voice in the public squares 
she calls at the head of noisy places at the entrance of the city gates she utters her words 
 how long you simple ones will you love simplicity ? how long will mockers delight themselves in mockery and fools hate knowledge ?
turn at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit on you i will make known my words to you 
because i have called and you have refused i have stretched out my hand and no one has paid attention 
but you have ignored all my counsel and wanted none of my reproof 
i also will laugh at your disaster i will mock when calamity overtakes you 
when calamity overtakes you like a storm when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind when distress and anguish come on you 
then will they call on me but i will not answer they will seek me diligently but they will not find me 
because they hated knowledge and didn t choose the fear of yahweh 
they wanted none of my counsel they despised all my reproof 
therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own schemes 
for the backsliding of the simple will kill them the careless ease of fools will destroy them 
but whoever listens to me will dwell securely and will be at ease without fear of harm 
my son if you will receive my words and store up my commandments within you 
so as to turn your ear to wisdom and apply your heart to understanding 
yes if you call out for discernment and lift up your voice for understanding 
if you seek her as silver and search for her as for hidden treasures 
then you will understand the fear of yahweh and find the knowledge of god 
for yahweh gives wisdom out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding 
he lays up sound wisdom for the upright he is a shield to those who walk in integrity 
that he may guard the paths of justice and preserve the way of his saints 
then you will understand righteousness and justice equity and every good path 
for wisdom will enter into your heart knowledge will be pleasant to your soul 
discretion will watch over you understanding will keep you 
to deliver you from the way of evil from the men who speak perverse things 
who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness 
who rejoice to do evil and delight in the perverseness of evil 
who are crooked in their ways and wayward in their paths 
to deliver you from the strange woman even from the foreigner who flatters with her words 
who forsakes the friend of her youth and forgets the covenant of her god 
for her house leads down to death her paths to the dead 
none who go to her return again neither do they attain to the paths of life 
that you may walk in the way of good men and keep the paths of the righteous 
for the upright will dwell in the land the perfect will remain in it 
but the wicked will be cut off from the land the treacherous will be rooted out of it 
my son don t forget my teaching but let your heart keep my commandments 
for length of days and years of life and peace will they add to you 
don t let kindness and truth forsake you bind them around your neck write them on the tablet of your heart 
so you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of god and man 
trust in yahweh with all your heart and don t lean on your own understanding 
in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight 
don t be wise in your own eyes fear yahweh and depart from evil 
it will be health to your body and nourishment to your bones 
honor yahweh with your substance with the first fruits of all your increase 
so your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will overflow with new wine 
my son don t despise yahweh s discipline neither be weary of his reproof 
for whom yahweh loves he reproves even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights 
happy is the man who finds wisdom the man who gets understanding 
for her good profit is better than getting silver and her return is better than fine gold 
she is more precious than rubies none of the things you can desire are to be compared to her 
length of days is in her right hand in her left hand are riches and honor 
her ways are ways of pleasantness all her paths are peace 
she is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her happy is everyone who retains her 
by wisdom yahweh founded the earth by understanding he established the heavens 
by his knowledge the depths were broken up and the skies drop down the dew 
my son let them not depart from your eyes keep sound wisdom and discretion 
so they will be life to your soul and grace for your neck 
then you shall walk in your way securely your foot won t stumble 
when you lie down you will not be afraid yes you will lie down and your sleep will be sweet 
don t be afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it comes 
for yahweh will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being taken 
don t withhold good from those to whom it is due when it is in the power of your hand to do it 
don t say to your neighbor go and come again tomorrow i will give it to you when you have it by you 
don t devise evil against your neighbor since he dwells securely by you 
don t strive with a man without cause if he has done you no harm 
don t envy the man of violence choose none of his ways 
for the perverse is an abomination to yahweh but his friendship is with the upright 
yahweh s curse is in the house of the wicked but he blesses the habitation of the righteous 
surely he mocks the mockers but he gives grace to the humble 
the wise will inherit glory but shame will be the promotion of fools 
listen sons to a father s instruction pay attention and know understanding 
for i give you sound learning don t forsake my law 
for i was a son to my father tender and an only child in the sight of my mother 
he taught me and said to me let your heart retain my words keep my commandments and live 
get wisdom get understanding don t forget neither swerve from the words of my mouth 
don t forsake her and she will preserve you love her and she will keep you 
wisdom is supreme get wisdom yes though it costs all your possessions get understanding 
esteem her and she will exalt you she will bring you to honor when you embrace her 
she will give to your head a garland of grace she will deliver a crown of splendor to you 
listen my son and receive my sayings the years of your life will be many 
i have taught you in the way of wisdom i have led you in straight paths 
when you go your steps will not be hampered when you run you will not stumble 
take firm hold of instruction don t let her go keep her for she is your life 
don t enter into the path of the wicked don t walk in the way of evil men 
avoid it and don t pass by it turn from it and pass on 
for they don t sleep unless they do evil their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall 
for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence 
but the path of the righteous is like the dawning light that shines more and more until the perfect day 
the way of the wicked is like darkness they don t know what they stumble over 
my son attend to my words turn your ear to my sayings 
let them not depart from your eyes keep them in the midst of your heart 
for they are life to those who find them and health to their whole body 
keep your heart with all diligence for out of it is the wellspring of life 
put away from yourself a perverse mouth put corrupt lips far from you 
let your eyes look straight ahead fix your gaze directly before you 
make the path of your feet level let all of your ways be established 
don t turn to the right hand nor to the left remove your foot from evil 
my son pay attention to my wisdom turn your ear to my understanding 
that you may maintain discretion that your lips may preserve knowledge 
for the lips of an adulteress drip honey her mouth is smoother than oil 
but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood and as sharp as a two edged sword 
her feet go down to death her steps lead straight to sheol 
she gives no thought to the way of life her ways are crooked and she doesn t know it 
now therefore my sons listen to me don t depart from the words of my mouth 
remove your way far from her don t come near the door of her house 
lest you give your honor to others and your years to the cruel one 
lest strangers feast on your wealth and your labors enrich another man s house 
you will groan at your latter end when your flesh and your body are consumed 
and say how i have hated instruction and my heart despised reproof 
neither have i obeyed the voice of my teachers nor turned my ear to those who instructed me !
i have come to the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the gathered assembly 
let them be for yourself alone not for strangers with you 
let your spring be blessed rejoice in the wife of your youth 
a loving doe and a graceful deer let her breasts satisfy you at all times be captivated always with her love 
for why should you my son be captivated with an adulteress ? why embrace the bosom of another ?
for the ways of man are before the eyes of yahweh he examines all his paths 
the evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him the cords of his sin hold him firmly 
he will die for lack of instruction in the greatness of his folly he will go astray 
my son if you have become collateral for your neighbor if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger 
you are trapped by the words of your mouth you are ensnared with the words of your mouth 
do this now my son and deliver yourself since you have come into the hand of your neighbor go humble yourself press your plea with your neighbor 
give no sleep to your eyes nor slumber to your eyelids 
free yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter like a bird from the snare of the fowler 
go to the ant you sluggard consider her ways and be wise 
which having no chief overseer or ruler 
provides her bread in the summer and gathers her food in the harvest 
how long will you sleep sluggard ? when will you arise out of your sleep ?
a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep 
so your poverty will come as a robber and your scarcity as an armed man 
a worthless person a man of iniquity is he who walks with a perverse mouth 
who winks with his eyes who signals with his feet who motions with his fingers 
in whose heart is perverseness who devises evil continually who always sows discord 
therefore his calamity will come suddenly he will be broken suddenly and that without remedy 
there are six things which yahweh hates yes seven which are an abomination to him 
haughty eyes a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood 
a heart that devises wicked schemes feet that are swift in running to mischief 
a false witness who utters lies and he who sows discord among brothers 
my son keep your father s commandment and don t forsake your mother s teaching 
bind them continually on your heart tie them around your neck 
when you walk it will lead you when you sleep it will watch over you when you awake it will talk with you 
for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light reproofs of instruction are the way of life 
to keep you from the immoral woman from the flattery of the wayward wife s tongue 
don t lust after her beauty in your heart neither let her captivate you with her eyelids 
for a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread the adulteress hunts for your precious life 
can a man scoop fire into his lap and his clothes not be burned ?
or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched ?
so is he who goes in to his neighbor s wife whoever touches her will not be unpunished 
he who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding he who does it destroys his own soul 
he will get wounds and dishonor his reproach will not be wiped away 
for jealousy arouses the fury of the husband he won t spare in the day of vengeance 
he won t regard any ransom neither will he rest content though you give many gifts 
my son keep my words lay up my commandments within you 
keep my commandments and live ! guard my teaching as the apple of your eye 
bind them on your fingers write them on the tablet of your heart 
tell wisdom you are my sister call understanding your relative 
that they may keep you from the strange woman from the foreigner who flatters with her words 
for at the window of my house i looked out through my lattice 
i saw among the simple ones i discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding 
passing through the street near her corner he went the way to her house 
in the twilight in the evening of the day in the middle of the night and in the darkness 
behold there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute and with crafty intent 
she is loud and defiant her feet don t stay in her house 
now she is in the streets now in the squares and lurking at every corner 
so she caught him and kissed him with an impudent face she said to him 
 sacrifices of peace offerings are with me this day i have paid my vows 
therefore i came out to meet you to diligently seek your face and i have found you 
i have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry with striped cloths of the yarn of egypt 
i have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon 
come let s take our fill of loving until the morning let s solace ourselves with loving 
for my husband isn t at home he has gone on a long journey 
he has taken a bag of money with him he will come home at the full moon 
with persuasive words she led him astray with the flattering of her lips she seduced him 
he followed her immediately as an ox goes to the slaughter as a fool stepping into a noose 
until an arrow strikes through his liver as a bird hurries to the snare and doesn t know that it will cost his life 
now therefore sons listen to me pay attention to the words of my mouth 
don t let your heart turn to her ways don t go astray in her paths 
for she has thrown down many wounded yes all her slain are a mighty army 
her house is the way to sheol going down to the rooms of death 
doesn t wisdom cry out ? doesn t understanding raise her voice ?
on the top of high places by the way where the paths meet she stands 
beside the gates at the entry of the city at the entry doors she cries aloud 
 to you men i call ! i send my voice to the sons of mankind 
you simple understand prudence you fools be of an understanding heart 
hear for i will speak excellent things the opening of my lips is for right things 
for my mouth speaks truth wickedness is an abomination to my lips 
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing crooked or perverse in them 
they are all plain to him who understands right to those who find knowledge 
receive my instruction rather than silver knowledge rather than choice gold 
for wisdom is better than rubies all the things that may be desired can t be compared to it 
 i wisdom have made prudence my dwelling find out knowledge and discretion 
the fear of yahweh is to hate evil i hate pride arrogance the evil way and the perverse mouth 
counsel and sound knowledge are mine i have understanding and power 
by me kings reign and princes decree justice 
by me princes rule nobles and all the righteous rulers of the earth 
i love those who love me those who seek me diligently will find me 
with me are riches honor enduring wealth and prosperity 
my fruit is better than gold yes than fine gold my yield than choice silver 
i walk in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of justice 
that i may give wealth to those who love me i fill their treasuries 
 yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work before his deeds of old 
i was set up from everlasting from the beginning before the earth existed 
when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were no springs abounding with water 
before the mountains were settled in place before the hills i was brought forth 
while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the beginning of the dust of the world 
when he established the heavens i was there when he set a circle on the surface of the deep 
when he established the clouds above when the springs of the deep became strong 
when he gave to the sea its boundary that the waters should not violate his commandment when he marked out the foundations of the earth 
then i was the craftsman by his side i was a delight day by day always rejoicing before him 
rejoicing in his whole world my delight was with the sons of men 
 now therefore my sons listen to me for blessed are those who keep my ways 
hear instruction and be wise don t refuse it 
blessed is the man who hears me watching daily at my gates waiting at my door posts 
for whoever finds me finds life and will obtain favor from yahweh 
but he who sins against me wrongs his own soul all those who hate me love death 
wisdom has built her house she has carved out her seven pillars 
she has prepared her meat she has mixed her wine she has also set her table 
she has sent out her maidens she cries from the highest places of the city 
 whoever is simple let him turn in here ! as for him who is void of understanding she says to him 
 come eat some of my bread drink some of the wine which i have mixed !
leave your simple ways and live walk in the way of understanding 
he who corrects a mocker invites insult he who reproves a wicked man invites abuse 
don t reprove a scoffer lest he hate you reprove a wise man and he will love you 
the fear of yahweh is the beginning of wisdom the knowledge of the holy one is understanding 
for by me your days will be multiplied the years of your life will be increased 
if you are wise you are wise for yourself if you mock you alone will bear it 
the foolish woman is loud undisciplined and knows nothing 
she sits at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city 
to call to those who pass by who go straight on their ways 
 whoever is simple let him turn in here as for him who is void of understanding she says to him 
 stolen water is sweet food eaten in secret is pleasant 
but he doesn t know that the dead are there that her guests are in the depths of sheol 
the proverbs of solomon a wise son makes a glad father but a foolish son brings grief to his mother 
treasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness delivers from death 
yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked 
he becomes poor who works with a lazy hand but the hand of the diligent brings wealth 
he who gathers in summer is a wise son but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame 
blessings are on the head of the righteous but violence covers the mouth of the wicked 
the memory of the righteous is blessed but the name of the wicked will rot 
the wise in heart accept commandments but a chattering fool will fall 
he who walks blamelessly walks surely but he who perverts his ways will be found out 
one winking with the eye causes sorrow but a chattering fool will fall 
the mouth of the righteous is a spring of life but violence covers the mouth of the wicked 
hatred stirs up strife but love covers all wrongs 
wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding 
wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin 
the rich man s wealth is his strong city the destruction of the poor is their poverty 
the labor of the righteous leads to life the increase of the wicked leads to sin 
he is in the way of life who heeds correction but he who forsakes reproof leads others astray 
he who hides hatred has lying lips he who utters a slander is a fool 
in the multitude of words there is no lack of disobedience but he who restrains his lips does wisely 
the tongue of the righteous is like choice silver the heart of the wicked is of little worth 
the lips of the righteous feed many but the foolish die for lack of understanding 
yahweh s blessing brings wealth and he adds no trouble to it 
it is a fool s pleasure to do wickedness but wisdom is a man of understanding s pleasure 
what the wicked fear will overtake them but the desire of the righteous will be granted 
when the whirlwind passes the wicked is no more but the righteous stand firm forever 
as vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes so is the sluggard to those who send him 
the fear of yahweh prolongs days but the years of the wicked shall be shortened 
the prospect of the righteous is joy but the hope of the wicked will perish 
the way of yahweh is a stronghold to the upright but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity 
the righteous will never be removed but the wicked will not dwell in the land 
the mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom but the perverse tongue will be cut off 
the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable but the mouth of the wicked is perverse 
a false balance is an abomination to yahweh but accurate weights are his delight 
when pride comes then comes shame but with humility comes wisdom 
the integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them 
riches don t profit in the day of wrath but righteousness delivers from death 
the righteousness of the blameless will direct his way but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness
